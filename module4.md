## Resource Allocation Approaches

**Competitive Market** = a market which has many buyers and sellers and no single buyer or seller can influence the price.

1. Market Price Approach

People who are willing and able to buy a resource, get the resource. Takes into account how much they want a good or service through their willinginess to pay. This is decentralized market approach.

2. Command System

Resources are allocated by the command of someone in authority. A planned market approach like Cuba or North Korea. A command system works well in organizations when very clear lines of authority exist. Becomes difficult to execute when the number of activities involved is large.

There are too many individuals with unique wants and needs to run this from a command center.

3. Majority Rules

Resources are allocated in accordance with the majority vote which is represented by an elected government.

Taxes are allocated in this manner.

4. Contest

Resources are allocated to a winner of a contest. For example, when a corporation has a prize for person with most sales, so individuals are motivated to work harder and the top performers are recognized for their achievement.

5. First-come, first-serve

A queue system where resources are allocated to this first to approach.

6. Lottery

Resources are allocated to individuals with the luck prize, such as first-year student housing, a lottery system.

7. Personal Characteristics

Resources are allocated to those with the right personal traits.

8. Force

Resources are allocated to those that forcibly take the resources.

**Individual Demand Curve** = the relationship between quantity demanded and the price of a good or service for a single individual.

**Market Demand Curve** = the horizontal sum of individual demand curves. Formed by adding the quantities demanded by all individuals at each price. Also referred to as the marginal social benefit curve (MSB).

If the quantity demanded by person A is 30 when the price is a dollar, and the quantity demanded by person B is 10 when the price is a dollar, then the marginal social benefit is 40 units when the price is a dollar.

This is the market quantity demanded.

## Consumer Surplus

Area above the market price line, but below the demand curve. This makes sense, consumers were willing to buy it at the demand curve, but only had to pay the market price line, meaning there was a surplus of value for the consumer.

When a good or service is bought for less than it is worth, this is consumer surplus.

**Consumer Surplus** = the excess of benefit received from a good or service over the amount paid for the good or service.

This is the marginal benefit of a good or service minus its price, summed over the quantity bought.

$$
CS = \sum_{quantity} benefit - price
$$

This is the area under the demand curve but above the market price.

For example, if the market price is $1, and at the 5th unit, you were willing to pay $5, then the consumer surplus for the 5th unit is $4.

If the demand curve is 2.50 - 0.05x and the market price is 1.00 then the consumer surplus is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{30} 2.50 - 0.05x dx - \int_{0}^{30} 1 dx \\
= 2.50x - 0.025x^2 \Big|_1^{30} - 1x \Big|_1^{30} \\
= (75 - 22.5 - 0 ) - ( 30 - 0 ) \\
= 52.5 - 30 \\
= 22.5
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore the consumer surplus is $22.5.

When price rises, the distance between the marginal benefit and the price becomes smaller, reducing the height of consumer surplus.

Consumers also decrease the quantity of output they demand.

Therefore a rise in price decreases consumer surplus, and a fall in price increases consumer surplus.

For firms, consumer surplus helps define product pricing strategies for goods/services.

The government and firms can benefit from understanding the net benefit when a price of a good or service changes.

## Individual Supply and Market Supply

**Individual supply curve** = the relationship between the quantity supplied and the price of a good or service for a single producer.

**Market Supply Curve** = the horizontal sum of individual supply curves. Also called the marginal social cost curve (MSC).

**Producer Surplus** = the excess of the amount received from the sale of a good or service over the cost of producing it.

It is the area above the supply curve, but below the market price. Which makes sense, it is the surplus earned by the supplier, they were willing to sell it at the supply curve, but got even more at a higher market price.

The marginal cost of a good or service minus its price, summed over the entire quantity sold.

$$
CS = \sum_{quantity} cost - price
$$

For example, if the marginal cost of producing the 15th unit is $10, but the market price is $15, then the 10th unit made $5 surplus.

When price rises, the distance between the marginal cost and the price increases, meaning there is greater surplus. Also, the quantity increases as the price rises, further increasing the producer surplus.

A rise in price increases producer surplus, and vice-versa.

Producer surplus is used to identify the net benefit or change when the price of a good or service changes.

## Competitive Market Efficiency

Competitive market equilibrium occurs when the marginal social cost curve, or market supply curve, equals the marginal social benefit curve, or market demand curve.

**Total Surplus** = the sum of consumer and producer surplus. The consumer and producer achieve the best surplus each when market equilibrium is achieved.

Achieve allocative efficiency where goods and services are produced at the lowest possible cost and at quantities that provide the greatest possible value.

**Market Failure** = when a market does not produce an efficient outcome as a result of the over or under production of a good or service.

## Underproduction

Underproduction of a good or service results in a shrink in consumer surplus and producer surplus.

The resulting allocation does not achieve allocative efficiency and we get a **deadweight loss**.

**Deadweight loss** = the decrease in total surplus that results from an inefficient level of production.

## Overproduction

The consumer is willing to pay less than the marginal cost incurred. Therefore society loses resources the extra units.

This results in another deadweight loss.

## Causes of Market Failure

1. Price or quantity regulations

Price or quantity regulations that place the price of a good or service above or below the market equilibrium price will result in an inefficient allocation.

2. Taxes and subsidies

A tax increases the price of a good of service paid by the consumer and decreases the amount received from a supplier of a good or service. Taxes lead to underproduction of a good or service as the quantity produced is reduced.

A subsidy decreases the price of a good or service paid by the consumer and increases the amount received from a supplier of a good or service.

Subsidies lead to the overproduction of a good or service as the quantity produced is increased.

3. Externality

cost or benefit that affects someone other than the buyer or the seller of a good or service.

It can be positive or negative, such as pollution. The local coffee shop is causing an increased level of pollution.

A competitive market fails to take into account the third-party effect. When a negative externality occurs, overproduction will occur and when a positive externality occurs, underproduction will occur.

4. Public goods and common resources

A public good is a good or service that is consumed simultaneously by everyone even if they don't pay for it.

Competitive markets tend to produce less than the efficient quantity of a public good due to the free-rider problem.

Some people take a free ride for a service by avoiding to pay for the good or service, resulting in underproduction.

A common resource is a resource that is owned by noone but is available for all to use and is free to charge, resulting in overproduction, like a public beach.

5. Monopoly

A firm that is the sole provider of a good or service. Since a monopoly has no competition, it tries to maximize profit, and produces too little at a higher cost.

6. High Transaction cost

Transaction cost is the cost of the services that enable a market to bring together buyers and sellers. It is the cost of doing business.

When a high transaction cost exists, underproduction occurs.

7. Information asymmetry

Info about a product or good is not equal on both sides of the market. The owner of a used car has more info than the buyer. The producer knows more about the consumer.

In this case, the market can under or over produce depending on who has the information.

## Efficient Allocation

A competitive market, without any of these obstacles, will have an efficient outcome.

There is no efficient mechanism for allocating resources in reality, but alternative resource allocation can be used to try and fix market failures.

Markets when supplemented with other market mechanisms can offer an efficient allocation of resources.

## Is a Competitive Market Fair

**Fairness**:

1. Fair Results View

It is not fair if the result is not fair. Utilitarianism is a principle that we should strive to achieve the greatest happiness for the greatest number of individuals. Argues that fairness requires equality of income, which requries that incomes are redistributed.

But income transfers create a big tradeoff between efficiency and fairness because taxes reduce people's incentive to work. We have a tradeoff because less work is done, but the profit is redistributed more evenly.

The size of the profit is reduced, so this is called not fair.

John Rawls proposed a modified utilitarianism view in 1971, believed that the difference in incomes can be attributed to inherent abilities and socio-economic status.

2. Fair Rules View

It is not fair if the rule is not fair.

**Symmetry principle** = people in similar opportunities should be treated the same way.

In 1974, Robert Nozick suggested that government should promote fairness by establishing property rights for individuals and allowing only voluntary exchange of these resources.

There is never a guarantee that a competitive market equilibrium will be fair, for some definition of fair.

## Is a Competitive Market Equilibrium Equitable?

How equitable is the distribution of income in Canada? A competitive market.

Households making the lowest received 4% of total income, households making the middle received 16% of total income, and the richest 20% of households received 44% of total income.

An income Lorenz curve graphs the cumulative percentage of income earned, the y-axis, against the cumulative percentage of households from lowest to highest incomes.

The line of equality would be y=x, where 40% of households make 40% of total income, etc.

The Lorenz curve for Canada has a more equal distribution compared to Brazil and South Africa, but less then Finland and Sweden.

Someone in the highest quartile receives 9x the lowest.

## Trends in equality

A Gini ratio is based on the Lorenz curve and equals the ratio of the area between the line of equality and the Lorenz curve to the entire area under the line of equality.

The larger the Gini ratio, the more unequal the income distribution.

The Gini ratio has increased from 0.38 to 0.46 from 1975 to 2010.

**Poverty** = a situation where a household's income is too low to be able to buy the quantity of food, shelter and clothing that are deemed necessary.

The level of poverty has fluctuated from 14% to 18% from 1975 to 2010.

In 2009 the richest 20% of households received 44.2% percent of total income and the poorest 20% received 4.9% of total income.

Income inequalities exists because of various market failures that cannot be effectively addressed. The competitive market structure does have points of failure.
