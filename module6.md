# Module 6

Income: $40
Movies: $8/each
Pop: $4/each

$P_p$ = Price of Pop
$Q_p$ = Quantity of Pop
$P_m$ = Price of Movies
$Q_m$ = Quantity of Movies
Y = Income

$$
Y = P_p * Q_p + P_m * Q_m \\
= $4 * Q_p + 8 * Q_m \\

\therefore Q_p = \frac{Y - Q_p * Q_m}{P_p}
$$

The generalized Budget Line Equation is:

$$
Q_y = \frac{Y}{P_y} - \frac{P_x * Q_x}{P_y}
$$

For our case, that's:

$$
Q_p = 10 - 2Q_m
$$

## Real Income

How much of something you can have if you spent all your income on it.

## Indifference Curve

An indifference curve is a line of goods and services which a consumer is indifferent about.

Above the indifference curve is what they prefer, but below the indifference curve is what they do not prefer. It looks like a reciprocal function

On the curve, the person is as satisfied consuming $x_1$ and $y_1$ as $x_2$ and $y_2$.

I don't care if I have 10 chips and 2 pops as 20 chips and 1 pop.

There are many indifference curves, which are represented as a preference map. A preference map shows how a person ranks various combinations of goods and services.

It's a series of indifference curves that resemble the contour lines of a map.

A representation of a consumer's preference towards various combinations of goods and services.

1. Bundles are combinations of goods and services lying on indifference curves further from the origin, because they have a higher level of utility.

2. There is an indifference curve running through every combo of goods and services.

3. Indifference curves do not cross.

### Marginal Rate of Substitution

Rate at which a person is willing to give up a good or service y on the y-axis to get an additional unit of good or service x.

The slope of the indifference curve at any point measures the marginal rate of substitution.

It's the derivative at any point on the MRS.

If MRS is low, then don't really want to give up one more unit of thing on y-axis for thing on x and vice-versa.

Diminishing marginal rate of substitution is the general tendency for a consumer to be willing to give up less of good or service y to get one more unit of x, and at the same time fall on the same indifference curve, with total preference being the same.

MRS also equals $$\frac{MU_y}{MU_x} where MU is the marginal utility of the good.

## Degrees of Suitability

An indifference curve tells us something about the degree of substitutability of two goods.

Degrees of substitutability are studied for:

1. Ordinary goods
2. Perfect substitutes
3. Perfect complements

### Perfect Substitutes

A perfect substitute is one where the consumer is completely indifferent which one they get.

They have no incentive to pick one over the other. Coke and Pepsi for example, I don't care.

Have a slope of 1.

### Perfect complements

Goods or services that must be consumed in a precise combination in order to provide a defined level of satisfaction.

Left and right shoes for example, form an L shape at 1 and 1 since we only want 1 of each. Having one left vs l0 left does not add any value.

## Consumer's Best Affordable Choice

Best affordable choice occurs when all income is spent and we're on furthest possible indifference curve.

Overlay the preference map, set of indifference curves, on the budget line.

She must take a point on the furthest indifference curve that intersects the budget line.

The best affordable choice is therefore:

1. On the budget line
2. On the furthest attainable indifference curve
3. Has a marginal rate of substitution (derivative of furthest indifference curve) between the two goods and services equal to the relative prices (slope of budget line) of the two goods and services.

The relative prices are the slope of the budget line, and the marginal rate of substitution is the derivative at a given point of the furthest indifference curve.

Recalling that MRS = $\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}$,
then we have MRS = the rate at which a consumer is willing to give up a good or service y to get more of x = relative price = rate at which a consumer can give up good or service y to get an additional unit of good or service x.

### Utility-maximizng Rule

A consumer's total utility is maximized if:

1. The consumer spends all of his/her total income.
2. The consumer equalizes the marginal utility per dollar for goods and services.

The consumer equilibrium that results from marginal utility theory is the same as the best affordable choice that results from indifference curve theory.

## Changes in Consumption

What happens to consumption, using indifference curve theory when:

1. The price of a good or service changes
2. Income changes

The new best affordable choice changes because the budget line changes and can intersect different indifference curves.

A price effect shows how a change in the price of a good or service affects the quantity of that good or service consumed.

If price increases for item on x-axis, buy less of it, and the slope is steeper, since the axes measure quantity sold.

If the price falls, buy more of it, and slope becomes flatter.

Change in income moves the budget line left, causing an intersection on a different indifference curve and a different tangent intersection.

## Substitution and Income effect

For a normative, a rise in the price always decreases the quantity consumed.

### Substitution

Change in the quantity of a good that a consumer demands when a good or service changes its price.

To isolate the substitution effect, need to reduce income for a price decrease, or increase income for a price increase.

Now that we are still on the same indifference curve, the point at which the MRS and budget line have the same slope has moved down the indifference curve.

When the price of a good fell, we substituted to get more of that good and less of the other.

### Income

The income effect is the effect on the quantity bought of a change in income sufficient to shift the hypothetical budget line used to measure the substitution effect so that it is the same as the actual new budget line.

The income effect is the change in the quantity of a good or service a consumer demands because of a change in income, holding prices constant.

Increase income, moving budget line up with same slope. It now tangents a different indifference curve.

When her income increased, the income effect reinforces the substitution effect, moving in the same direction for a normal good.

Meanwhile for an inferior good, the substitution effect is positive and the income effect is negative.

1. If negative income effect on inferior goods = the positive substitution effect, then the demand curve is vertical and there is no change.

2. If the negative income effect < positive substitution effect, then the demand is downward slowing, but elastic for a normal good.

3. If negative income effect > positive substitution effect, then a fall in prices results in decrease in quantity bought.

Which would therefore be a positive slope demand curve, which is rare.
