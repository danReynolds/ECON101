## Externalities

**Externality** = an effect that production or consumption of a good or service has on third parties not involved in the production or consumption of the good.

An externality can be negative or positive. A negative externality imposes an external cost.

A positive externality creates an external benefit.

Externalities can also be classified into the categories of:

1. Negative Production

Noise from airplanes and trucks, pollution in the air, and water bodies.

2. Negative consumption

Smoking in a confined space, loud stereo noises.

3. Positive Production

Honey and fruit, bees benefit from the resources of the fruit, fruit benefits from the pollenation by bees.

4. Positive Consumption

Flu Vaccination, consume the vaccine and now everyone else around you is less likely to get it as well.

Left unregulated, competitive markets will overproduce goods with negative externalities and underproduce goods and services with positive externalities.

Leads to economic inefficiency.

## Negative Externalities

**Private Cost of Production** = the cost that is borne by the producer of a good or service. Paying for land.

**Marginal private cost, just MC** = the cost of producing an additional unit if a good or service that is borne by the producer of a good or service.

**External cost** = a cost of producing a good or service that is not borne by the producer of a good or service. Cost of society cleaning up pollution.

**Marginal external cost** = the cost of producing an additional unit of a good or service that falls on people other than the producer of the good or service.

**Marginal Social Cost (MSC)** = the marginal social cost incurred by the entire society for a good or service.

Cost incurred by the producer and by anyone else on whom the cost falls

MSC = MC + marginal external cost

Economists place a dollar value on pollution to society, an external cost.

The MSC is the total of the marginal private cost line and the marginal external cost.

The market is efficient where the MSC = MSB.

But the firm will product at MC = MSB, which is further because the MC is less than the MSC because MC does not add the cost to societal externalities like pollution.

Where MC=MSB is an inefficient level of output, because it is not MSC=MSB. A deadweight loss arises, equal to the triangle between the MSC line and the MC=MSB point.

If left to its own devices, the market sets the wrong price for the good or service because it fails to take account of the effect of the good or service on third parties.

Too much output is produced, causing a deadweight loss of too much pollution.

## Property Rights

The inefficiencies resulting from a negative externality can possible be addressed by establishing property rights.

**Property Rights** = legally established titles to the ownership, use and disposal factors of production and goods and services that are enforceable in courts.

A chemical company owns homes that they rent and which is polluted by the company. If the rent people are willing to pay depends on the pollution in the river, then they'll pay $2500 along the river if no pollution, or $1000 per month if lots of pollution.

Now there is foregone rent that could have been earned if pollution had been throttled. This shifts production back down to the point where MSC=MSB.

Property rights can help address the economic inefficiency that results from a negative externality.

## The Coase Theorem

Does it matter how property rights are assigned? Who has property rights will not affect the efficiency of the outcome.

> If property rights exist when few parties are involved and the transaction costs are low, then the private transactions are efficient and there will be no externalities.

**Transaction costs** are the opportunity cost of conducting a transaction.

If the victims value the benefits of being free from pollution more highly than the polluters value the benefits from polluting, the efficient outcome is for it to stop.

If polluters are assigned the right to pollute, then the victims will pay the polluter enough to stop the pollution.

If the victims are assigned the right to be free of pollution, the polluters are not able to pay the victims enough compensation to continue pollution.

Property rights can help address a negative externality, but only when few parties are involved and the transaction costs are low, which is not always the case.

## Government Action in a Market with External Costs

When the Coase theorem does not hold and transaction costs are high, the government has three main methods of action:

1. Taxes

The government can set a tax equal to the marginal external cost, so the marginal private cost plus the tax equals the marginal social cost.

MSC = MC + tax

The pollution tax makes the market equilibrium where MSC=MSB by using the tax to force pollution down.

This type of tax is called a Godian tax, but it costs money to collect the tax, and overhead.

2. Emission Charges

price per unit of pollution is charged. If the emission charge is exactly equal to the marginal external cost, then an efficient outcome will result.

But determining the exact amount of marginal external cost is not an easy procedure and comes at a cost.

The task is also costly because getting this information right requires overhead.

3. Marketable Permits

Least costly, cap-and-trade approach. Firms creating pollution absorb the cost. Each polluter is assigned a permit that allows the firm to emit only a certain amount of pollution and the firm can trade their permit.

Firms that reduce their pollution level below their limit can sell their excess reduction to other firms that produce more.

Firms internalize the process for monitoring their pollution level. Firms are incented to introduce technology that helps reduce their pollution level under their permitted level.

4. In addition, the governments can simply ban the activity that generates the negative externality. For example, you cannot burn trash because of the air pollution.

## Positive Externalities

Education is a good example.

**Private benefit of production** = the benefit that is borne by the consumer of a good or service

**Marginal private benefit (MB)** = the benefit of consuming an additional unit of a good or service that is borne by the consumer of that good or service.

**External benefit** = a benefit of consuming a good or service that is not borne by the consumer of a good or service.

**Marginal external benefit** = the benefit of consuming an additional unit of a good or service that falls on people other than the consumer of the good or service.

**Marginal social benefit (MSB)** = the marginal benefit incurred by the entire society for a good or service.

MSB = MB + marginal external benefit.

Marginal social benefit curve is the sum of the marginal external benefit and the marginal private benefit curve.

If schools were private, however, they would only take as many students as made sense given a MSC and a MB curve. They do not take into account the MSB curve.

This is inefficient, the efficient outcome is at MSC=MSB. There needs to be a way to get rid of this deadweight loss. The market fails to take into account the effect of the good or service on third parties.

There is too little output, students, graduated and we have a deadweight loss.

## Government Action in the Face of External Benefits

1. Public Provision

Public provision of a good or service is when the government provides the good or service and the public authority receives the revenue from the good or service, in the form of taxes.

The government can charge prices below the cost that equals the marginal private benefit at the efficient quantity. The additional cost is paid by the taxpayer to yield a cost equal to the MSC.

The taxpayers make up the different between the MB and MSB.

2. Private Subsidies

A subsidy is a payment the government makes to private produces. If the subsidy is equal to the marginal external benefit, then the quantity produced by the private firm increases to the point where the MSC=MSB, an efficient allocation.

With a subsidy, the MB becomes the MSB, and we have MSB=MSC.

3. Vouchers

Token that the government provides to households to provide a specific good or service. A voucher applied to education is an amount paid to households in order to send their children to a particular school.

The theory behind the approach is to provide those in financial need with the opportunity to go to school. Ontario grant.

4. Patents and Copyrights

All forms of intellectual property rights that equate to gains for the creator. Which can in turn spark potential creators to seek more education to help them invent a good or service.

## Classifying Goods and Resources

**Excludable** = a good or service is excludable if only the people who pay for the good or service are able to enjoy its benefits, like paying a fee to see zoo animals.

**Non-Excludable** = a good or service is non-excludable if everyone benefits from the good or service regardless of if they paid for it, like a public park, or streetlights in a sub-division.

**Rival** = a good or service is rival if its use by one person decreases the quantity available for someone else, food.

A hammer is a rival good, as only one can use it at a time, but after it can be passed on.

**Nonrival** = a good or service is non-rival if its use by one person does not decrease the quantity available for someone else, like radio.

The discipline of economics categorizes goods, services and resources into four categories:

1. Private Goods

A private good is both rival and excludable. A food item is excludable because only you get it, it is rival because there is now less food available for someone else.

2. Public Goods

A public good is both non-rival and non-excludable. Sunshine is non-excludable, can't say who gets it, who doesn't, and doesn't take it away from others by using it.

3. Common Resources

A common resource is rival and non-excludable. Can't choose who gets the fish, but whoever does prevents others from getting it.

4. Natural Monopoly

A natural monopoly is both non-rival and excludable. Cable television is non-rival, you don't decrease who can watch it by watching it, and excludable, the company can determine who gets to watch it.

## Free-Rider Problem

A free-rider is someone who enjoys the benefits of a good or service without paying for the good or service, because a public good cannot exclude someone.

A free-rider problem exists because of the absence of an incentive for people to pay for what they consume.

Individuals who do not pay for transit when it is an honor system are free riders.

When free riders exist, the market is inefficient and a deadweight loss arises.

## Marginal Social Benefit from a Public Good

Sum of all the marginal benefits for all individuals at each quantity.

Public goods have a MSB that differ from private goods. The MSB for a public good is the max amount that all people are willing to pay for another unit.

The principle of a increasing marginal cost applies to the marginal cost of a public good.

The efficient quantity is the quantity at which MSB=MSC.

## Inefficient Public Provision

Without government intervention, little to no public goods would be produced.

The public marketplace fails to achieve efficiency when providing a public good because of the free rider problem.

But the government provision of a public good is not always efficient.

## Two Types of Political Equilibrium

Efficient and inefficient, which corresponds to two theories of government.

**Social interest theory**: predicts that the government makes choices that are efficient.

Which assumes that voters are well-informed and simply refuse to support inefficient policies.

**Public choice theory**: predicts that government makes choices that are inefficient.

Assumes that voters are rationally ignorant, that bureaucrats seek to increase the scale of their programs, and that voters mistakenly support inefficient policies proposed by politicians.

## Review

1. To help clean up their town, Smithville is considering placing a tax on any firm that serves take-out food. The revenue from the tax will be used to help clean-up crews collect burger wrappers and associated paper cups.

What type of externality is being associated with take-out food and beverages?

A negative externality is being addressed with take-out foods and beverages because of the pollution from discarding wrappers and beverage containers.

2. Identify if a positive or negative externality is assocaited with the following:

A person driving is talking on their cellphone: negative consumption, increased risk of injury to others

A homeowner plants a beautiful garden in their lawn: positive consumption, price of surrounding houses goes up

A person is wearing very strong perfume to a public event: negative consumption, people get in a bad mood, might have allergic reactions.

3. If the government cuts a subsidy to colleges, why will tuition rise and the number of students decrease?

The MSC used to equal the MSB, but now MSC > MSB, so the college must shift the supply of positions available left, increasing the cost of tuition and decreasing the number of positions.

4. Is every publicly-provided good a public good?

No, a publicly provided good includes a green-bin. This is owned by a specific person, and is a rival good. by providing it to a person, there are fewer green-bins left.

5. What is a free-rider problem and why does it make the provision of a public good inefficient?

If a firm were to provide a pure public good, it would suffer from a free-rider problem.

There are people who are using the good that did not pay for the good, and there is an absence of an incentive for people to pay for what they consume.

It is inefficient because efficiency would have been achieved if the free-riders had also paid for the good.

A private firm would not receive enough revenue to provide an efficient level of a public good.

6. Does the 401 highway suffer from a free-rider problem?

Yes, it does have a free-rider problem. If all provinces use part of the gas tax received from sales of gasoline along the road to maintain the highway, then it could be solved.

Currently the gas tax does not necessarily go to the highway, people who use it might not be paying their fair share towards its cost of maintenance.

The funds collected from the tax could be used to help maintain the roads. Or a toll charge could be placed along the road.
