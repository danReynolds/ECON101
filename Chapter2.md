# Production Possibilities and Opportunity Cost

The **Production Possibilities Frontier** (PPF) is the boundary between combinations of goods and services that can be produced and those that cannot.

It shows the relationship between producing more of one good, and how this results in less production of another.

## Production Efficiency

Production efficiency is achieved if we produce goods and services at the lowest price possible.

Only when production is on the line of the PPF is this lowest cost achieved.

In the pizza/cola example, the opportunity cost of making more pizza, the cost of doing more of an activity, is less cola.

Opportunity cost is the ratio of the decrease in the quantity of one good to the increase in the quantity of another.

For example, the world wants more cocoa, but if we make more cocoa, we cannot make as much of other things. The opportunity cost of making x more cocoa and losing y everything else is $\frac{y}{x}$.

The more we produce of a good, the less productive the additional resources are. Once we exhaust good cocoa makers, we start taking away from other goods, but the new producers aren't good at making cocoa. We then get only a little cocoa for a lot of lost other goods, resulting in a high opportunity cost.

**Allocation efficiency** = goods and services are produced at the lowest possible cost and in the quantities that provide the greatest possible benefit.

the **marginal cost** of a good is the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of it.

If the PPF graph drops from 12 million other goods to 9 million in order to make 1 million more cocoa goods, then the marginal cost here is on average $\frac{3}{1}$ over this range.

Based on the tangent of the lines, at 2.5 million cocoa goods, it is a slope of 3 other goods, so only at 2.5 million cocoa goods is the marginal cost exactly 3.

The marginal cost at every point can then be graphed. Marginal cost graphs **increase** as more of one good is produced, since you lose an increasingly large amount of other goods for an increasingly small gain of the one.

**Marginal benefit** = benefit from consuming one or more unit of a good. Marginal benefit is subjective and depends on people's preferences.

It is unrelated to the PPF. The marginal benefit is measured by the **most** that people are willing to pay for an additional unit of it.

**Principle of Decreasing Marginal Benefit** = The more we have of a good or service, the less we are willing to pay for it.

## Allocative Efficiency

At the best point on the PPF, we cannot produce more of one good without giving up some other good.

It is simple to find the optimum amount of one good to produce, based on the hit taken to the others.

Looking at marginal cost and marginal benefit, if making more of $a$ results in fewer other goods $b$ than people value $a$, do not produce more of $a$.

Marginal benefit has a negative slope, since the more we make of $a$, the less people value $a$.

Marginal cost has a positive slope, since the more we make of $a$, the more $b$ we must give in order to make $a$.

Where marginal benefit and cost interest is where making any more of $a$ would be worth less than the value of lost $b$ in terms of $a$.

Therefore allocative efficiency is achieved at the intersection of marginal benefit and cost.

## Economic growth

**Technological Change** = how we can makes things better with better tech.

**Capital Accumulation** = growth of capital resources, including human capital.

If an economy devotes all of its factors of production to producing consumption goods and none to advancing technology, then it will always have the same production possibilities.

To expand production possibilities for the future, a nation or economy must invest in the future. As production possibilities expand, consumption in the future can increase.

Investing in the future comes at an immediate cost but with long-term gains.

## Gains from Trade

Specialization is producing only a few goods. People gain by producing a good that they have a comparative advantage with.

A person has a comparative advantage if they can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than anyone else.

Some people do better in school than others than others. They have an **absolute advantage** over others if they can get more work produced per hour than the average person.

If person $a$ can make 5 smoothies in the time it takes them to make $1$ salad, and person $b$ can make them at the same rate, then person $a$ has a comparative advantage in making smoothies, since her opportunity cost is \$frac{1}{5}$, one salad lost for 5 smoothies. Whereas the other is $\frac{1}{1}$, so the opportunity cost is lower for person $a$.

Person $b$ has a comparative advantage in making salads, since the opportunity cost is $\frac{1}{1}$
versus $\frac{5}{1}$ 5 smoothies lost for 1 salad for $a$.

If $a$ and $b$ only make the items that they have a comparative advantage for, then they can benefit eachother:

To $a$, a salad is worth 5 smoothies, and to $b$, a salad is worth 1 smoothie. if $b$ sells a salad to $a$ for 2 smoothies, then $b$ benefits from more smoothies than would have been possible, and $a$ benefits from more salads than possible.

Both PPF's are improved through the deal.

## Economic Coordination

Centralized economic planning is hard because economic planners don't now people's production possibilities and preferences. They need to know what everyone is capable of.

Decentralized coordination works best, but to do so it needs four complementary social institutions:

1. Firms: economic unit that hires factors of production and organizes them to produce and sell goods and services.

2. Markets: a market is any arrangement that enables buyers and sellers to get information and to do business with each other.

3. Property Rights: the social arrangements that govern the ownership, use and disposal of anything that people value.

Real property are physical items like buildings, machines, etc.

Financial property includes stocks and bonds, and money in the bank.

Intellectual property includes patents, copyrights, inventions.
