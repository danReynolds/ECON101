# Module 11

**Price Ceiling** = a government regulation that makes it illegal to charge a price higher than a specified level.

The impact that a price ceiling has on a market depends on where the price ceiling is being imposed, whether above or below the market equilibrium price.

If it is above, it has no impact, as market forces would not allow the price to go higher than the equilibrium anyways.

If a price ceiling is below the market equilibrium, it has a powerful impact on the market.

## Rent Controls

A rent control is a rent-ceiling that is a government imposed regulation making it illegal to charge any higher than the regulation for rent.

Social groups believe that the government should ensure that essential services like housing should be available to all members of society.

A rent-ceiling causes a:

* **Housing shortage**: Landlords need to take time to adjust to the new price, and the number of units will decline, as landlords try turning units into different venues that can make a greater return.

New units will not be made, because less profit.

Supply of housing units is more elastic in the long-run, more inelastic in the short-run.

If the market has a supply and demand curve that would meet at equilibrium of 80000 units at $1000, but the government imposes a limit of $800, then a shortage occurs, as the horizontal rent-ceiling at $800 intersects a supply of only 60000 units, and a demand for 100000 units. There is therefore a shortage of 40000 units.

Shortage = difference between the quantity demanded and quantity supplied at the ceiling price.

* **Increase in Search Activity**: The time spent looking for someone with whom to do business. This is costly, as the opportunity cost of the good or service increases.

There is foregone leisure or income that is lost because people are busy looking for units.

* **Black market** = an illegal market in which the price exceeds a legally-imposed price ceiling.

Tenants are forced to bribe landlords given the shortage caused by the price ceiling, or landlords charging a large amount for repairs and other utilities. Landlords have the upper-hand and may not upkeep the rental units and repair them because they know that in a shortage, there will always be someone who wants to live there.

In a black market, there will be people who will pay the full $1200 on the demand line that occurs at the quantity of 60000, above the rent ceiling.

This is breaking the law.

## Inefficiency of Rent Ceiling

Rent ceilings lead to inefficiency when compared to an unregulated market. Consumer and producer surplus is reduced and a deadweight loss results, as both consumer and producer surplus shrinks.

## Are Rent Ceilings Fair?

Two ways of defining fair:

1. Fair Results Review: Not fair if the result is not fair.

Using the fair results criteria, a rent ceiling is fair because the rent ceiling helps the poor and disadvantaged.


2. Fair Rules View: Not fair if the rule is not fair.

Using the fair rules criteria, a rent ceiling is not fair because a rent ceiling blocks voluntary trade.

It is both fair and unfair depending on the view.

Rent controls are generally not the best option for giving the poor and disadvantaged housing.

**Price floor** = regulation that makes it illegal to charge a price lower than a specified level.

Minimum-wage legislation is one example, intended to help members of society. The impact that a price floor on a market depends on whether the price floor is above or below the market equilibrium price.

A price floor below the market equilibrium has no impact, but a price floor above the market equilibrium has an impact on the market.

### Minimum Wage

Protect the working poor. Minimum wage legislation that is imposed at a level that is above the equilibrium creates unemployment.

If the equilibrium is $9 wage for 21 million people, but the wage floor is at $10, then the demand line is 20 million at $10, so companies can only ask for fewer jobs at that higher price, and the supply line is higher at 22 million, since people can't work for $9, there is a larger supply of people who want jobs for $10.

Therefore the unemployment is the difference between the new points on the supply line and the demand line where they meet the minimum wage horizontal line. This is 2 million unemployed people.

There is an excess supply of labour, and more workers will spend time searching for work.

### Inefficiency of Minimum Wage

Therefore, minimum wage leads to inefficiency when compared to an unregulated market. Worker and firm surplus is reduced and a deadweight loss results.

The full cost to society is the sum of the potential loss to job searching + the deadweight loss.

### Is Minimum Wage Fair?

1. Fair results view: The fair results view says it is unfair, because workers who become unemployed are worse off than they would be with no minimum wage.

2. Fair rules view: The fair rules criteria says it is not fair, because minimum wage blocks voluntary exchange. Even if firms were willing to hire more labour at a wage people were willing to take, like $9, they aren't allowed to.

A rise in the minimum wage rate increases the number of unskilled workers who cannot find work. Those who keep jobs benefit, those who do not have a job already are even worse off, because it is harder to find a job.

## Tax Incidence

**Tax Incidence** = the division of the burden of tax between a buyer and a seller.

The buyer's burden arises when the price paid by the buyer rises after a tax is imposed.

The seller's burden arises when the price received by the seller falls after a tax is imposed.

Tax incidence does not depend on whether the tax law imposes a tax on the buyer or the seller.

## Tax on Sellers

Tax on sellers shifts the supply curve leftward by the amount of the tax. The tax is a cost the seller must pay and now they can afford to produce less.

If cigarettes are sold for $6 at 350 million, but then a $3 tax is placed on the seller, then, supply curve shifts left, driving up the price for the buyer.

The price paid by the buyer is now $8, at 325 million. The vertical distance between the new and old supply curve is the tax value.

To get the new price for the buyer, its the new point of intersection between the shifted supply curve and the constant demand curve. To get the new price for the seller, walk down the new point of intersection until you hit the old supply curve.

The burden of the tax is shared by the buyer and the seller, but not equally. The price paid by the buyer increases from $6 to $8, but the price received by the seller decreases from $6 to $5 per pack.

Even though the tax was imposed on the seller, both the buyer and seller see the burden.

## Tax on Buyers

The buyer pays the tax to the government. The demand curve shifts left because the buyer is not willing to pay as much to the buyer.

The vertical distance between the old and new demand curve is the price of the tax.

The equilibrium quantity decreases, the price received by the seller falls to $5 from $6, and the price paid by the buyer is raised to $8.

The new price for the seller is the new price at the intersection of the new demand curve and the constant supply curve. To get the new price for the buyer, walk up the new intersection point until you hit the old demand curve.

The burden of the tax is again shared by the buyer and the seller. The price paid by the buyer increases by $2, and the price received by the seller decreases from $6 to $5. Even though the tax is imposed on the buyer, the burden is imposed on both.

A tax on a buyer and a tax on the seller had the same effect. The buyer pays $2 of the tax, and the seller pays $1 of the tax. The same equilibrium prices result if the tax is on the buyer or the seller. They do not share the same burden equally.

Regardless of whether a tax is imposed on buyers or sellers, the tax leads to the same outcome in terms of a new equilibrium price and quantity.

The tax burden is split the same way, regardless of who is responsible for paying the tax to the government.

But that tax burden is not necessarily split evenly between the buyer and the seller.

## Tax Incidence

So what determines who carries the burden of the tax?

It depends on the elasticity of supply and demand.

### Tax Incidence and the Elasticity of Demand

When demand is perfectly inelastic, the demand curve is a vertical line, the buyer pays the entire burden of the tax.

For insulin, with no tax the price of a dose of insulin is $2. A tax on the seller of $0.2 per dose raises the price to $2.20, shifting the supply curve leftward.

Individuals are still willing to pay for it, so the less elastic the demand, the larger the tax burden paid by the buyer and the smaller the tax burden paid by the seller.

When demand is perfectly elastic, the seller pays the entire burden of the tax, because any change in price would result in no-one buying anything. So the seller can't change the price and takes the hit of the tax.

The demand curve is perfectly elastic, so consumers will buy a pencil anywhere, as long as its the cheapest, so its elastic.

Generally, the more elastic the demand, the larger the tax burden paid by the seller and the smaller the tax burden paid by the buyer.

Perfectly inelastic = buyer pays all of the tax
Perfectly elastic = seller pays all of the tax

The burden of tax depends on the elasticity of demand.

## Tax Incidence and the Elasticity of Supply

When supply is perfectly inelastic, a vertical line, the seller pays the entire burden of the tax.

The supply remains the same, so the seller pays the tax.

In general, the less elastic the supply, the larger the tax burden paid by the seller and the smaller the tax burden paid by the buyer.

They can't change how much they're making, so if they don't want it wasted, they can't change charge the buyer because then they wouldn't be selling some. They need to take the hit themselves.

When supply is perfectly elastic, the buyer pays the entire burden of the tax. The seller just wouldn't sell it if they had to pay more, so the buyer has to take the hit if they want it still.

Generally, the more elastic the supply, the smaller the tax burden paid by the seller and the greater the tax burden paid by the buyer.

perfectly inelastic supply = seller pays all the tax
perfectly elastic supply = buyer pays all the tax

## Tax Incidence

It is the elasticity of demand relative to the elasticity of supply that is really key to determining how much burden a seller and a buyer pay of a tax.

As long as neither is prefectly elastic or inelastic, the burden will be shared.

## Are Taxes Inefficient?

Taxes lead to inefficiency when compared to a market without tax. Taxes put a wedge between the marginal benefit and the marginal cost, which creates inefficiency.

Taxes cause the marginal social benefit from the last unit sold to be higher than the marginal social cost and the market underproduces the good or service being taxed.

The quantity produced is less than the efficient quantity and we get a deadweight loss.

In the extreme case when demand and supply are both perfectly inelastic, a tax does not change the quantity bought or sold.

## Are Taxes Fair?

We will assess this question through:

1. **The Benefits Principle** = a proposition that people should pay taxes equal to the benefits they receive from the services provided by the government.

Under this principle, a tax is fair, because those who benefit from the service pay for the service. A federal tax on gasoline is one example, taxes from gasoline goes towards highway maintenance, so they are paying for the benefit they receive, good highways.

2. **Ability-to-pay Principle** = a proposition that people should pay taxes according to how easily they can bear the burden of the tax.

Some taxes can be fair, because those who can bear the impact of the tax pay the tax, while those who cannot bear the burden of the tax are not being asked to pay the tax.

Like how those with higher incomes pay more than those with lower incomes.

## Production Quotas

**Production Quota** = the upper limit on the quantity of a good that may be produced during a specific period of time.

The impact of a production quota on a market depends on where the production quota is being imposed, above or below the market equilibrium quantity.

A production quota above the market equilibrium quantity has no impact on a market.

A production quota that is under the market equilibrium will result in:

* A decrease in supply
* A rise in price
* A decrease in marginal cost
* An inefficiency from underproduction
* An incentive to cheat and overproduce

A farmer can get a larger profit by producing beyond the quota.

If all farmers end up cheating, the purpose of the quota is defeated. The price will just continue to fall as more supply enters the market.

## Subsidies

**Subsidies** = payment made by the government to the producer

A subsidy results in:

* An increase in supply
* A fall in price
* Increase in the quantity produced
* Increase in marginal cost
* Payment by the government to farmers
* Inefficiency from overproduction

The marginal social cost is greater than the marginal social benefit, bringing about overproduction and resulting in inefficiency.

The subsidy creates a deadweight loss, and a lower price paid by consumers.

## Market for Illegal Goods

Penalties can be imposed on the sellers, which decreases the supply and shifts the supply curve leftwards when compared to the market with no penalty.

This raises the price of the good and decreases the quantity. The demand curve remains unchanged, so the equilibrium price of the good rises and the quantity decreases.

Imposing penalties on buyers shifts the demand curve leftwards, which lowers the price of the good and decreases the quantity.

Imposing penalties on both buyers and sellers shifts both, definitely decreasing quantity but price is indeterminant.

If the decrease in demand exceeds the decrease in supply, then the price falls.

If the decrease in demand is less than the decrease in supply, then the price is raised.

The larger the penalty, and the greater the enforcement, the larger the shifts in supply and demand. Want penalties and enforcement high enough to inhibit the buying and selling.

But doing these things have high cost. Instead, legalize the drug and tax them. The price of the drug will be higher and the quantity consumed lower. But if a very high tax is required to reduce the consumption, then the high tax may induce buyers and sellers to engage in black market trade.

## Review

1. Based on the market for rental housing, what is the equilibrium rent and equilibrium quantity of rental housing?

The equilibrium rent is $300 a month and the equilibrium quantity is 30000 units.

If a ceiling is set to $150 a month, the supply drops since landlords aren't willing to only make $150 and get out of the business, while demand increases since there are more people who will pay $150, since they can't pay > $150 anymore. This means less supply and greater demand, with a housing shortage of 50000 - 10000 = 40000 units.

The quantity supplied is 10000 units.

The quantity demanded is 50000 units.

The maximum price that someone is willing to pay for the 1000th unit is $450 per month.

The demand curve shows the max price that someone is willing to pay.

2. Discuss how a minimum wage creates an inefficient allocation of labour resources.

A minimum wage increases the supply of people seeking jobs in the market, all who must be paid at the higher price. It decreases the quantity of jobs demanded by companies in the market, since they now have to pay more for workers. This is an inefficient allocation because there are now more unemployed people.

A competitive labour market allowed to reach its equilibrium creates an efficient allocation of resources.

At the equilibrium, the amount of employed is such that the marginal social cost of labour to workers is equal to the marginal social benefit from labour to firms.

A minimum wage set above the equilibrum wage rate creates a surplus of labour.

The quantity of labour supplied exceeds the quantity of labour demanded. The minimum wage reduces employment such that it is less than the efficient amount.

3. How does the elasticity of demand influence the incidence of tax, tax revenue and deadweight loss?

The more elastic the demand, the smaller the increase in price paid by the buyer and the greater the increase in price paid by the seller.

Incidence on buyers is smaller.

The more elastic the demand, the smaller the quantity bought so the smaller the tax revenue and the larger the deadweight loss.

4. How does elasticity of supply influence the incidence of tax, tax revenue and deadweight loss?

The more elastic the supply, the greater the increase in price paid by the buyer, and decrease in price drop felt by the seller.

Incidence on sellers is small.

The more elastic the supply, the higher the price for buyers, so demand decreases, and revenue falls, deadweight loss increases.

5. Why is a voluntary quota hard to operate?

A voluntary quota is hard to operate because the production quota gives way to an incentive to cheat on the production quota by increasing production.

A production quota decreases the quantity produced, raising the price and reducing the marginal social cost of the last unit produced.

6. How does the imposition of a penalty for selling or possessing an illegal drug influence demand, supply, price and the quantity of the drug consumed?

The demand and supply curves both shift leftward.

If the shift of the supply curve is greater, then price rises.
If the shift of the demand curve is greater, then price drops.

It always results in a decrease in quantity.
