## Monopolistic Competition and How it Arises

A market structure has:

* Many firms
* Differentiated products that are good substitutes
* No restrictions to entry

Each firm has a slightly different good or service, like clothes. No barrier to entry, anyone can get in, no one power has a monopoly and barriers to entry.

## Large Number of firms

Due to a large number of firms in the market:

1. Each firm has a relatively small share of the overall market
2. No firm can dictate market conditions
3. The possibility of collusion is low

**Collusion** = illegal co-operation and the conspiring among firms to fix a higher price

In monopolistic competition, it is simply too hard to get all firms to collude together, and it is unlikely.

## Product Differentiation

**Product differentiation** = each firm makes a good or service that is slightly different from the other goods or services.

Due to product differentiation, the market demand curve for a firm in a monopolist competitive market is downward sloping.

Not perfectly elastic, like in the case of a perfectly competitive market like for wheat, because the product of the rival firms are not perfect substitutes.

So if you change your price, not everyone will go to the other person who is still at the lower price, because you have differentiated your product.

The more rivals and the smaller the product differentiation, the greater the elasticity will be, because if they can get basically the same product somewhere else for a lower price, you will lose all customers.

A firm can set the price and quantity of their good or service. As they raise the price, the quantity demanded will fall by the amount of customers who believe their special traits that differentiate them is not worth the cost.

The marginal revenue curve is also downward sloping, as this must follow from a downward sloping demand curve. As more is produced, people are willing to pay less for it so over time revenue drops and profit drops given a constant marginal cost.

Product differentiation in a monopolistic competitive market allows firms to compete with rivals on quality, price and marketing.

**Quality** = the physical attributes of a product like design, service, liability and ease of access.

**Price** = each firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve. A high quality firm may price higher.

**Marketing** = firms can make consumers aware of the quality of their differentiated product through advertising and packaging

## Entry and Exit

Firms in a monopolist competitive market are free to enter and exit the market. Not free fiscally, but free as in possible.

Firms seek to maximize economic profit.

Economic profit = total revenue - total cost

With no barriers to entry, **firms in a monopolist competitive market make zero profit in the long run**.

If firms are earning a profit over the short-run, new firms will enter the market, due to the fact that there is no barrier to entry and existing firms lose market share until profit diminishes to zero.

## Price and Output in a Monopolistic Competition

### Short-Run Quantity and Price Decision

To achieve maximum economic profit, a firm in a monopolistic competitive market must decide what quantity to produce.

In addition to decisions about good or service quality and marketing.

At each level of output, marginal revenue is less than the price. Total revenue depends on whether the increase in quantity sold has a bigger effect than the decrease in price. Sell more for cheaper gives certain revenue, whereas selling fewer for higher gives certain revenue, want to maximize the balance.

The marginal revenue curve has a steeper slope than the demand curve and falls at a faster rate than demand. This is because to increase the output, the firm must lower the price on all output. This means that marginal revenue hits marginal cost sooner, and less quantity is produced.

Maximize profit at the point where MR=MC and sells it at the price on the demand curve.

Economic profit is price on demand curve - price on average total cost.

When price > ATC, the firm earns an economic profit
When price < ATC, the firm incurs an economic loss

A loss can occur when a firm faces too low demand for its good or service. If where MR=MC, the price on the demand curve is below the average total cost curve, than an economic loss occurs.

If price equals ATC, then the firm earns zero economic profit over the short-run. Makes sense.

## Long-Run Quantity and Price Decision

With no barriers to entry, firms in monopolistically competitive industries make zero economic profit in the long-run.

As new firms enter, more competition is in place and existing firms lose customers. The demand curve shifts leftward, and existing companies have a surplus, forcing them to lower prices until price = ATC.

New entry to the industry stops, as new firms would incur an economic loss and not make profit, so there is no incentive to enter the market.

In summary, a firm in a monopolistically competitive market that has already determined the quality of its produced and its marketing programs produces at the level of output where MR=MC, as this maximizes profit.

## Monopolistic Competition and Perfect Competition

In perfect competition, firms produce where MR=MC, so the price is MR, and the ATC is equal to the price, so their is zero economic profit. AT this point, we are at the lowest point on the ATC curve.

We call this the **Efficient Scale** = the quantity that minimizes the average total cost.

Meanwhile, in monopolistic competition, the firm has a downward sloping demand curve, and the quantity produced is less than the quantity of the efficient scale, it **produces less** than the quantity that is the minimum total cost, the lowest point of the ATC, because since demand and marginal revenue are downward sloping, the marginal cost line will intersect the marginal revenue line sooner, and less quantity will be produced than in a perfectly competitive market which has the same marginal cost curve, but a horizontal marginal revenue curve, meaning the point of intersection is further.

Some restaurants will have open tables, some gas stations have pumps open at a given time, not in use, there is **always excess capacity**. The **Excess Capacity** is the different between how much a perfectly competitive produces and a monopolistically competitive market produces. Perfectly competitive produces more output, because of its flatter demand and marginal revenue curves.

Why wouldn't a firm just reduce its price to increase sales? If it does, its MR<MC and will likely incur a loss, even thought given more quantity sold.

In monopolistic competition, in the long-run, MR=MC, and P=ATC. So no profit is made.

A firm's markup is the amount by which price exceeds marginal cost. P > MC by the markup amount.

**Markup** = the amount by which price exceeds marginal cost.

So the markup is the comparison of how much you're charging to the marginal cost, the rate at which the cost is changing.

A markup exists because in monopolistic competition, price is greater than marginal revenue at all levels of output.

So there is a markup above marginal cost, even though the firm is making no profit.

In a perfectly competitive market, the price is lower, since the marginal revenue and marginal cost intersect at the lowest average total cost, whereas in the monopolistic competition, they intersect at a higher point, meaning there is a higher price.

When comparing a firm in monopolistic competition with a firm in perfect competition, over the long run the main differences are:

1. Excess capacity
2. Markup over marginal cost

## How Efficient is Monopolistic Competition?

When compared to a firm in a perfectly competitive market, a firm in a monopolistic competitive market:

* Produces less output
* Sells output at a higher price

So do the social benefits of a monopolistic competitive market outweigh the social costs?

The benefit is a variety of goods and services due to product differentiation.

So is the cost savings of transforming monopolistic competitive industries to perfectly competitive industries worth the loss of product differentiation?

Is the higher cost of variety among goods and services worth the higher price and in what circumstances?

Do we have too much variety of goods and services in society? Is the excess superfluous?

## Product Development and Marketing

Competition comes from product differentiation in these monopolistic markets.

Other than adjusting price, the two main ways in which firms in a monopolistic competitive environment compete is through:

1. Innovation and Product Development
2. Advertising

## Innovation and Product Development

Firms want to innovate to keep an edge over competitors. Firms need to weight the marginal costs of new product development versus the marginal revenue.

If an economic profit results, new development can allow a firm to gain a competitive edge and economic profit over the short run.

Over the long run, new firms will enter the market and compete away the profits by decreasing demand, forcing the company to lower price until price = ATC = zero economic profit.

Firms need to continuously innovate if they wish to make an economic profit over the short run.

The innovation and development is efficient if the marginal benefit to the consumer for the new good or service is equal to the marginal cost to the firm for the new good or service.

But not all innovation and development is efficient.

Consumers may not see the innovation as beneficial, such as in the software industry where in the example of BB10, Blackberry accrued a large cost for the development of software that did not resonate with users and did not boost sales above the added cost, resulting in a heavy loss.

To many consumers, the added software is of little perceived value and are not willing to pay the price for the new software.

## Advertising

Advertising allows a firm to differentiate its product.

Advertising can identify specific production information.

Advertising can also signal to the consumer about product quality and not necessarily convey specific information about the good or service.

**Signal** = an action taken by an informed person or firm to send a message to an uninformed person or firm.

An example of advertising that uses signalling are TV commercials that do not say anything about the product, but is just flash.

A form of advertising is a brand name.

**Brand name** = a name that is owned by a firm that distinguishes the firm's good or service.

Brand names provide quality, and assurance that the good or service purchased is consistent with the reputation associated with the brand. But a brand name can often result in too much product power.

A form of advertising is product packaging. All want to entice the consumer through packaging to buy a product.

## Advertising

Advertising costs are fixed costs that increases the ATC, at any given level of output.

But advertising could also decrease the ATC if output increases enough as a result of the advertising. Since average total cost is U-shaped and will initially drop. If this drop is greater than the fixed cost of advertising, then advertising has increased profit.

Advertising costs do not impact marginal costs, as variable costs are not impacted by advertising.

If all firms advertise, then each firm's demand curve becomes more elastic.

With no firms advertising, demand is low, but markup is large.

If all firms advertise, then advertising increases cost but makes demand more elastic. Price falls and markup shrinks.

When demand becomes more elastic, output increases, price falls, and the firm's markup shrinks. This is because the more elastic it is, the more people will buy it as a result of a drop in price, so as the price on the demand curve drops, the quantity increases, making the slope of the demand curve smaller and the same thing happens to the marginal revenue curve, it also becomes flatter.

Necessarily, output increases since marginal revenue is flatter and intersects marginal cost at a further output. Markup decreases since the difference between the point MR=MC is closer to the price on the demand curve.

So in conclusion, if all firms advertise, then the demand curve becomes more elastic, output increases, price falls and the firm's markup shrinks.

## Efficiency of Advertising

From an economic standpoint, is advertising effective?

Many people argue that it is effective if it increases demand, but others say it is effective only when the entire cost of the advertising effort is paid for.

It can also provide info to consumers about product difference and quality and improve a consumer's well-being benefiting society.

If the marginal social benefit from advertising is greater than the marginal social cost from advertising, then advertising can increase efficiency.

Answer depends on the situation.

## Oligopoly and How it Arises

An oligopoly has a small number of firms with no close substitutes but only slight differentiation. Some barriers to entry exist, but not as many as in a monopoly.

While the goods and services are almost the same, they are slightly different like Coke and Pepsi and strategically interact with each-other.

How firms interact with each-other makes it interesting. They can be fierce competitors or unite and act like a monopoly.

The government may need to intervene if a monopoly is being formed.

Each of the small number of firms have market power. Market power does not equate to size, they can be small. A small town can have two small grocery stores competing.

The firms in the market are interdependent. Each firm's profits depends on the firm's actions, and the actions of other firms in the oligopoly market.

The firms are interdependent because they each have a large market share and what one does will affect the other.

There is the possibility of **collusion**, and firms may conspire to set a higher price.

**Cartel** = a group of firms acting together, they are illegal but do operate in some markets.

The cartel acts like one large firm, a monopoly. They often breakdown because they have difficulty co-ordinating and sharing profit. The incentive to cheat the others exists.

Oil cartel teamed up and reduced production of oil to drive-up price. If firms compete versus collude, they do the opposite and increase production to try and undercut competitors and steal consumers with their higher volume and corresponding lower prices.

A small number of firms exist in an oligopoly market because of natural or legal barriers.

A **Natural barrier** exists when the existence of economies of scale is in place. Such as the bus lines in a city, can only have so many, and cheaper for few than many to exist.

**Duopoly** = an oligopoly with two firms.

The behaviour of firms in an oligopoly is analyzed by using game theory.

Given the interrelated nature of the firms in an oligopoly, there is no easy solution for the output and price decision.

## Game Theory

A game, in economics, is a tool used to study strategic behaviour.

Behaviour that takes into account the expected behaviour of others and the recognition of interdependency.

Games in economics have four key components:

1. Rules: Specify allowable actions by game players
2. Strategies: actions taken by game players. Takes into account the actions of others and recognizes the mutual interdependence of actions.
3. Payoffs: Payoffs are profit and losses associated with game players
4. Outcomes: Outcomes are determined by choices made by game players

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

### Scenario:

Art and Bob have been sentenced to jail for 2 years for stealing a car.

Both men are suspected of committing a more serious crime, for which the prosecutor has insufficient evidence for a conviction.

### Rules:

Each prisoner is placed in a separate room. If only one person confesses and his accomplice does not, then the person confessing will only serve a 1-year sentence for the crime and the other accomplice will receive a 10-year sentence for the crime.

But if they both confess, they each will receive a 3-year sentence.

If neither confesses to the more serious crime, they each will spend 2-years in prison.

### Strategies:

Confess to the crime or deny the crime.

### Outcomes:

Both confess
One confesses
Neither confess

### Payoffs

Uses a **payoff matrix**, a table that shows the payoffs for every possible action by each player for every possible action by each player.

          Confess Deny
          ------- ----
Confess   3/3     10/1
Deny      1/10    2/2

Art's strageies are along the top, Bob's strategies are along the side.

**Nash equilibrium** = each player makes his/her own best possible action given the action of the other.

If Bob confesses, Art should confess.
If Bob denies, Art should confess.

If Art confesses, Bob should confess.
If Art denies, Bob should confess.

Each player's best action is to confess. This Nash equilibrium is called a **dominant-strategy equilibrium**, as the best strategy is to confess regardless of the strategy of the other.

The smartest outcome would be to confess if you don't trust the other, and if you trust them not to implicate you, then the best strategy is to deny.

## Applying The Prisoner's Dilemma to an Oligarchy Price-Fixing

Two firms Gear and Tricks make an agreement with each-other to price-fix. The strategies are comply or cheat.

If they both cheat they make nothing, but if one cheats they make a lot, and the other loses.

if they both comply they both make the same amount, but not as much as if they cheated and the other complied.

A Nash equilibrium is again a dominant strategy, as regardless of what the other does, you should cheat. If they comply, then you make more by cheating, if they cheat and you cheat, you both make nothing, but you don't lose anything.

## Review

1. How is a firm in monopolist competition similar to a monopoly firm?

Each firm has the ability to raise their market price. Each firm can raise their market price through marketing efforts and product differentiation.

Marginal revenue < P at all levels of output. In the long-run, both markets are inefficient in the strict allocative sense:

Production does not occur at the lowest possible unit cost.

P = MSB > MSC at the equilibrium, so each firm produces less than is socially efficient.

2. Identify three firms that are considered examples of monopolistic competition:

Cable television services, sport shoes, toothepaste.

3. Based on the following diagram, identify the following:

Equilibrium output: 30
Equilibrium price: 15
Total revenue: 450
Total Cost: ~330
Total profit: 120

4. What does it mean for a product to be differentiated? Provide some examples of how a product can be differentiated.

When a good or service is slightly different from other goods or services, the product is differentiated.

Firms can use various methods to differentiate goods or services, through service levels, sizes, colours or packaging.

5. Identify three firms that are considered an oligopoly:

Canned Soups, Banking systems, local grocery stores in a small town, automotive industry. All only slightly differentiated but large market share. Some barriers to entry, interdependent on each-other.

6. What is the equilibrium of the following one-time played game?

The equilibrium is that both firms cheat and that each makes zero profit.

7. Advertising is sometimes viewed as an unnecessary cost to society. Can you identify two advantages that advertising brings to society? In addition, identify two disadvantages that advertising brings to society.

Some advantages:

Provides information to customers to help them make rational choices.

Helps support national broadcasting, as money from ads help to keep radio alive.

Disadvantages:

Unethical advertising that is intended to persuade rather than inform.

Given the costs, has the risk of being unproductive. Costs should have been allocated somewhere else to benefit society.
