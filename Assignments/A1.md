# Assignment 1

1.

a) Buying a car from General Motors sends money from households to the goods market, and on to firms. It also sends goods from firms to the goods market, and on to the households.

b) General Motors paying the designer of the car sends money from the firm to the factors market and on to the households. It also sends the labour factor of production from the households to the factors market and on to the firms.

c) General Motors expanding its plant and renting an adjacent building is a consumption of a factor of production, capital, from the factors market towards the firm. It is also a flow of money from the firm to the factors market, to pay for this consumption.

d) General Motors hiring a summer student is a flow of money from the firm to the factors market, which then goes to the households. It is also a flow of labour from households to the factors market, and then to the firm.

2.

a) The opportunity cost is the ratio of the goods produced to the goods lost. In this case, Sue can produce 4 jackets at the cost of not producing 40 caps. Therefore $opp_s = \frac{4}{40}$, and the opportunity cost of producing a cap for Sue is 0.1 jackets.

b) Similarly for Tessa, $opp_t = \frac{4}{80}$, therefore the opportunity cost of producing a cap for Tessa is 0.05 jackets.

c) Tessa has a comparative advantage in producing caps, because she can produce the caps at a lower opportunity cost than Sue.

d) Both Sue and Tessa gain from the specialization and trade. If Sue specializes in jackets, and Tessa specializes in caps, then if Sue trades 1 jacket for 15 caps, Tessa gets a jacket, which has an opportunity cost of 20 caps to Tessa, for only 15 caps. Similarly, Sue gets 15 caps for the opportunity cost of 10 caps.

Both Sue and Tessa benefit from this trade, since they both get better value than they would have otherwise been able to achieve.

3. The Law of Demand states that, with all factors remaining the same, as the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded for that good will fall.

One example are gas prices. When gas prices fall, more quantities of gas are sold, since people want to get a better deal. When gas prices rise, people hold out on getting gas, and demand falls since they are waiting for the price to lower.

The example given does not violate the Law of Demand because while both the price and quantity increased, not all other factors remained the same as the law requires.

The number of people who will want to see an older movie that has been in theaters for a long time is lower than the number of people who want to see a new blockbuster movie. While the price increased, the number of people who will want to go to the movie also increased and that is why there are more people at the blockbuster, despite the larger price.

4.

We want to find equilibrium price where the demand and supply curves intersect. To do this, we set the functions defining the curves equal to eachother.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_1 = 100 - 5Q \\
P_2 = 40 + 10Q \\
P_1 = P_2 \\
100 - 5Q = 40 + 10Q \\
60 = 15Q \\
Q = 4 \\
P_1 = P_2 = 100 - 5 * 4 = 80
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore the equilibrium price is 80 and the and the quantity is 4.

5.

$$
E_d = \frac{\frac{100 - 200}{150}}{\frac{2.00 - 1.50}{1.75}} \\
= -2.33
$$

Taking the absolute value, $E_d > 1$, therefore the demand for chicken is elastic. With an increase of price by 1, the demand decreases by 2.33. This makes sense, because a relatively small change in price resulted in a large drop in pounds per day demanded, which means that the demand is heavily influenced by the price. This corresponds to the definition of an elastic demand.

The owner of the Burger Barn can use a cross elasticity of demand calculation to determine if decreasing the price of the milkshakes has ever resulted in an increased demand for hamburgers and consequently an increased revenue. If there is a relationship between decreasing the price of milkshakes and increased hamburger sales then he may be able to predict the outcome of the sale.

He can also look at a cross elasticity calculation on sale days for milkshakes or other products to see if sales in general result in more sales of goods because of an increased population who come to the store when a sale is on.

Assumptions that are made include the fact that past data could have been influenced by other factors that the owner cannot control. He is not operating in a closed system and while normally having sales or decreasing the price of milkshakes results in more hamburger sales, other factors like poor weather, simultaneous sales from other stores, and events around the city are just a few uncontrolled factors that could affect hamburger revenue if he were to hold the sale.

7.

a) The income effect states that if the price of a good increases, then the people who buy that good must now buy less of it, or other goods, since their incomes have remained the same.

When the price of gasoline rises and other things remain the same, people can buy fewer other goods to afford the higher price of gasoline, or must buy less gasoline until the price drops. They could also drive less, resulting in a drop in car sale and maintenance revenue.

b)

1) Bottled water and health club memberships are complementary goods and services, as many people who go to the health club drink water. If more people get health club memberships, more bottles of water will be sold. The increase of one good or service has a positive effect on the demand for the other.

2) SUVs and pickup trucks are substitute goods. If the price of pickup trucks go up and fewer people buy trucks, then more people will turn to SUVs as a cheaper alternative to the pickup trucks. Negative demand for one good or service results in positive demand for the other.

3) Low-fat milk and cream are also substitute goods. If the price of milk drops, then more people might consider using milk in their coffee rather than cream, since it is now more economically attractive.

8)

a) Melting ice cream is an example of a good that has an elasticity of supply of zero. If a grocery store's power goes out, and they only have a limited amount of time before their ice cream melts and must be thrown out, then the price of the ice cream does not matter. They will sell the ice cream at any price in order to get rid of it and the supply will not change.

b) A toothbrush is an example of a good that has a positive elasticity of supply. As the price of a toothbrush increases or falls, the supply of toothbrushes will rise or fall. The particular quantity change that will result from a change of the price by 1 is neither infinite, or 0 and will be an integer within that range.

c) A sports car that costs $100000 to produce and is sold for $100001 will be perfectly elastic if the price drops in any way. Once consumers value the car at less than it costs to make it, suppliers will not produce any more of the car.

9.

This statement is false. It is incorrect to conclude that the price of Internet services will decrease as the demand increases, since increasing the demand should shift the demand curve right, increasing the equilibrium price.

Meanwhile, the second sentence is correct, as the fall in the price of Internet services will mean that producers cannot afford to supply as much Internet service and maintain the data centers and transmission facilities for lower revenue.

10.

a)

Choosing on the margin means that in each situation, you consider the cost and benefits of each unit change.

One example of what is meant by choosing at the margin is to choose to go to bed at 3 in the morning after having stayed up late to study. Earlier in the night, the choice had been made to stay up late and forgo sleep, but at the incremental choice of choosing between staying up another hour from 3 to 4 and getting hardly any sleep it is decided that it is not worth the very small gain that would occur from another hour of even more tired studying.

Another example of choosing at the margin is for a politician in an upcoming election to make another television appearance. With all the work already poured into the election, the cost of another appearance is a few hours work for an increase in support that might help them win a riding for their party. Given the small opportunity cost and potentially large reward, it makes sense to make another appearance rather than take the time off.

b)

Marginal analysis is an important policy tool for economics, although it becomes very complex to predict the effect of a policy, given all of the factors that could influence the result and are changing simultaneously.

I believe marginal analysis can be used in combination with other techniques to make decisions about policy, such as in the upcoming election. The NDP have noted that they would consider pipelines to go from the West to East, rather than North to South, to increase jobs for Canadians. They feel there is a demand for Canadian jobs, and in an attempt to shift the supply curve of positions to a better equilibrium, they have chosen this stance on the issue.

I believe marginal analysis makes sense in a lot of policy-making, and I am sure it is used in very complex scenarios to act as support for economic policies in all kinds of industries.
