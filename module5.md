# Consumer Budget Line

1. Consumption Possibilities

**Consumption Possibilities are all the goods and services that a consumer can afford to buy given an income and good or service.

**Budget Line** = a line that marks the boundary between those combinations of goods and services that a consumer can afford to buy and those that the same consumer cannot afford to buy.

Can graph one good against another, with a line showing how many of each they can get.

**Utility** = benefit or satisfaction that an individual gets from the consumption of a good or service.

**Total Utility** = the total benefit that a person gets from the consumption of goods and service.

**Marginal Utility** = the change in utility that results from a one-unit increase in the quantity of a good or service consumed.

All goods and services that people value will have a positive marginal utility.

Pollution is an example of something that has a negative marginal utility.

Marginal utility diminishes as the quantity of a good or service increases. The more you have of something, the less benefit it has to have a little bit more.

The benefit or satisfaction that an individual gets from 5 to 6 of something is less than 2 to 3. This the principle of **Diminishing Marginal Utility**.

Total utility peaks when marginal utility is zero. Once there is no benefit anymore, afterwards it will have a negative total utility. The maximum total utility is when the derivative is 0. The benefit is 0 and it no longer makes sense to have any more.

## Utility-Maximizing Choice

Consumers have limited resources and want to achieve maximum possible utility. But preferences a consumer has also influence what goods and services a consumer purchases. A budget line constrains what a consumer can purchase.

We have to combine:

1. The constraints imposed by a budget line
2. Along with consumer preferences
3. To find a combination of goods and services that provide a consumer with the maximum available utility

A consumer equilibrium occurs when a consumer allocates all of his/her available income in a way that maximizes utility, given the prices of goods and a budget constraint.

## Marginal-analysis Approach

A consumer's utility is maximized when they spend all available income and the marginal utility per dollar is equal across all goods and services purchased.

Set them equal across all goods and services.

Marginal analysis is basically a greedy algorithm where you always take the higher ratio of utility/cost until the budget is 0.

If a good drops in price, then the marginal utility per dollar increases, and demand increases.

If income increases, the demand for two graphed goods will both shift right. These are normal goods, since an increase in income causes an increase in demand.

## Paradox of value

Water costs little, but diamonds cost a lot. The total utility of all water compared to diamonds is much greater.

The marginal utility of water is relatively low, since we consume lots of water.

The marginal utility from any diamond is relatively high, since each one has high benefit.

## New Ways of Explaining Consumer Choices

1. Behavioural Economics

Focus on ways in which limits on human brain activity to compute and implement rational decisions influences economic behaviour.

Three impendiments to enabling rational behaviour:

  1. Bounded rationality is constrained by the brain's computing power
  2. Bounded willpower is the less than optimal willpower that prevents us from making a decision that we will regret later.
  3. Bounded self-interest is the limited self-interest that sometimes results in holding back our own interests. Giving donations to a charity for example.

2. Neuroeconomics

The study of activity of the human brain when a person makes an economic decision.

## Review Questions

1. What is the distinction between total utility and marginal utility?

The total utility is the sum of all the utility from past choices up until the present obtained from the goods or services consumed. The marginal utility is the change in total utility, the benefit from consuming one more unit of a good or service.

2. Does a good with a higher total utility also have a higher marginal utility? No, while a good may have had a lot of benefit up until this point, it suddenly has a very low marginal utility and the total utility may even decrease as a result of consuming/purchasing one more unit. An example is a driver's license. The total utility for one license is high, but two is actually a smaller total utility, because it means one must be counterfeit, which is illegal and has a negative benefit.

Water has a high total utility, but a low marginal utility. The value of the next bottle of water is low.

3. If you are writing a test that has lots of questions, how should you allocate your time among the test questions in order to secure the highest score according to marginal analysis?

You would do the ones with the highest utility, the greatest benefit, first in order to secure the highest score.

4. If a consumer's income increases, and if all goods and services are normal, explain how the quantity bought of each good and service changes.

If a consumer's income increases and all goods are normal, then the consumer will buy more of each good and service and the budget line shifts to the right.

The consumer will reach a higher total utility. A rightward shift in the demand curve for the good or service occurs.

5. Sarah is consuming tea biscuits according to her optimal consumption bundle, explain what this means. How does Sarah react when an increase in the price of biscuits occurs?

If Sarah is consuming her optimal bundle of tea and biscuits, that means she has allocated her income such that the marginal utility per dollar from biscuits equals the marginal utility per dollar from tea.

MU per dollar of tea = MU per dollar of biscuits

If the price of biscuits rises, the marginal utility for tea increases and Sarah will buy more tea and fewer biscuits until the marginal utility is again equal.

5        51            1                1/5

Since there are multiple points where marginal utility per dollar is equal for the good, the consumer selects the point that maximizes total utility.

This is at $23.
