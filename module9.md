## Monopoly and How it Arises

Only one firm, no close substitutes. Firm is protected by a barrier providing restrictions to entry to newcomers.

Monopolies may also have a geographic dimension, like the only grocery store in hundreds of miles.

Monopoly is the market.

**Barrier to entry** = a constraint that protects a firm from potential competition.

Three types of barriers to entry in relation to a monopoly:

1. Natural: occurs when due to economies of scale, one firm can supply the entire market at the lowest possible cost. One firm can supply the whole market at less cost than if two tried to. Creates a natural monopoly.
2. Ownership: one firm owns most of the reserves of a resource, for example, giving them a monopoly.
3. Legal: patent, government license, or copyright restricts entry.

**Public franchise** = an exclusive right that is granted to supply a good or service.

**Government license** = when the government controls entry into a particular occupation, profession, or industry.

**Taxi cabs** = need a license to drive a taxi cab. Meant to prevent consumers from fraud, but monopoly can have bad effect.

**Patent** = exclusive right to the inventor of a product or service, but can lead to stagnation because noone else can pursue the technology.

**Copyright** = exclusive right granted to author, etc of a piece of work.

## Monopoly Price-Setting Strategies

Monopoly firms are price makers. Can choose the price it wants to charge. Can cause price to change by adjusting quantity, allowing it to exploit the market.

The power to set prices is market power.

Market power is restricted by what consumers are willing and able to pay.

The price setting strategy depends on the type of monopoly:

1. **Single-price monopoly**: a firm sells each unit for the same price to all of its customers.

2. **Price descrimination** = the practice of selling different units of a good or service for different prices.

The market demand curve for a good or service in a monopoly is downward sloping. Since they're the only one in the industry, the firm demand curve = the market demand curve.

 **Economic Profit** = total revenue - total cost (including normal profit)

## Demand and Marginal revenue

To achieve maximum economic profit, the monopolist must decide what quantity to produce.

The marginal revenue curve is a downward sloping line, like the demand curve. At each level of output, marginal revenue is less than the price. Total revenue depends on whether the increase in quantity sold has a bigger effect than the decrease in price.

The marginal revenue curve has a much steeper slope than the demand curve.

In order to increase sales, it needs to decrease price on all units sold, not just last unit sold.

If demand is elastic, a fall in price results in an increase in total revenue. Total revenue is increasing and marginal revenue is positive.

If demand is inelastic, a fall in price results in a decrease in total revenue. The revenue gained from increase in quantity sold is outweighed by loss of revenue by lower price.

If demand is inelastic, then total revenue is decreasing and marginal revenue is negative.

If demand is unit elastic, a fall in price does not change total revenue. The revenue gain from increase in quantity sold is offset by the loss of revenue from the lower price. Total revenue is not changed and marginal revenue is zero.

Total revenue is maximized when marginal revenue is zero.

A profit-maximizing monopoly will never produce a level of output in the inelastic range of the market demand curve, as profit will be negative and they could increase profit and revenue by producing less.

A single-price monopoly firm maximizes its profit by producing an amount of output such that marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

Find the point where the MR and MC curves meet, and then set the price to the value of the demand curve at that point, indicating the price we should set. Makes sense, before that, revenue was higher than cost, since they are negative and positively sloping respectively, so we were still making marginal profit until the point where they meet. Since they're lines, they'll never meet again so we know this is the maximum profit.

A monopoly firm can earn an economic profit over the long run because barriers to entry protect the firm from competition. But a monopoly firm is not guaranteed an economic profit.

Over the short run, a monopolist might incur an economic loss, where price is less than average total cost, but over the long-run.

## Summary

* A profit-maximizing monopoly will never produce at a level of output in the inelastic range of the market demand curve.
* A single-price monopoly firm maximizes its profit by producing an amount of output such that marginal revenue equals marginal cost
* A monopoly firm can earn an economic profit over the long run because of barriers to entry that protect the firm from competition
* But a monopoly firm is not guaranteed an economic profit

## Comparing Price and output

Compared to a firm in a competitive industry, a single-price monopoly firm produces less output and sets a higher price.

The more a monopolist produces, the less they make per unit.

## Efficiency Comparison

In a competitive equilibrium, the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, if there are no externalities.

Then the demand curve is the same as the marginal social benefit curve and the supply curve is the same as the marginal social supply curve.

At the competitive market equilibrium, the marginal social benefit equals the marginal social cost. Resources are being used efficiently.

Meanwhile, in a monopoly, they produce less output at a higher price, resulting in greater producer surplus, but less consumer surplus. The consumer surplus is the different between the highest price consumers will pay on the demand curve/marginal social benefit curve and the price sold, while the producer surplus is the difference between the marginal social cost curve and the price.

**Deadweight loss** = the total loss of consumer and producer surplus and is a measure of inefficiency of a monopoly.

In a monopoly, consumer surplus shrinks because the consumer has to pay more for a good or service, and there's less of the good or surplus.

At the same time, producer surplus expands. The producer captures some of the consumer surplus. The monopolist is converting the lost consumer surplus into profit for themselves.

The monopoly has a net gain, and a net loss for the consumer.

A single-price monopoly creates a deadweight loss that is inefficient. A social cost exists as the deadweight loss represents a loss to society.

The social cost can even be even greater than the deadweight loss.

## Rent Seeking

**Economic Rent** = any form of consumer surplus, producer surplus or economic profit

**Rent seeking** = the pursuit of wealth by capturing economic profit

Rent seeking, in relation to a monopoly, occurs when someone pursues a monopoly status and it is common for firms trying to form a monopoly and raise profit.

Rent seeking occurs in 2 ways:

1. If someone uses resources to purchase monopoly rights at a price less than the monopoly profit

2. If someone expends resources to lobby the government in search of monopoly status

The resources used in rent seeking situations are costs to society that adds to the monopoly's deadweight loss because the resources do not generate output.

As there are no barriers to entry in the activity of rent seeking, the resources used up for rent seeking can equal the monopoly's potential economic profit.

## Rent Seeking Equilibrium

Can increase cost such that no economic profit results. Shifts the average total cost curve, to the point where the firm breaks even and potential economic profit is lost.

When compared to a firm in a competitive, the monopoly firm:

* produces less
* sells output at a higher price
* produces less efficiently at a higher cost, resulting in a deadweight loss to society.

Resources used in rent-seeking situations are costly to society that adds to the monopoly's deadweight loss.

Being free from the pressures of competition, the monopolist produces at levels less than socially optimal.

## Capturing Consumer surplus

**Price Discrimination** = the practice of selling different units of a good or service for different prices

Founded on a premise that tries to get buyers to pay a price for a good or service that is closest to the buyer's willingness to pay for the good or service.

To be able to price discriminate, a firm must be able to:

* Identify and separate among different types of buyers
* Sell a product that cannot be resold
* Address any challenges that may arise from customers paying a larger price

A price discriminating firm can charge a higher price to buyers with a higher willingness to pay and charge a lower price to buyers with a lower willingness to pay.

Airlines often charge business traveller a different rate than non-business travellers, for example.

A price discrimination firm can charge a higher price for the first units of a good or service and a lower price for later units purchased. Discrimination among units of a good or service.

## Profiting from Price discrimination

Converts consumer surplus into producer surplus, raising the monopolist's economic profit.

In the case of airplane tickets, charge more during busy times, so they are converting consumer surplus that would have gone to the consumer into producer surplus by charging more.

**Perfect** price discrimination occurs if a firm is able to sell each unit of output for the highest price that anyone is wiling to pay for it.

The price of each unit is the same as the marginal revenue, so the firm's downward sloping demand curve is the same as its marginal revenue curve. They charge the max possible such that people will still buy it, maximizing producer surplus and removing all consumer surplus.

Then where MR = MC, again it maximizes profit. But, the more perfectly a monopoly can price discriminate, the greater the amount the firm will generate and the firm becomes more efficient.

But if rent seeking occurred, economic profit might be reduced. Price discrimination is hard, you can easily get buyers upset.

ex. want to go to hockey game, but tickets sold out so buy from scalper. This is the reselling of tickets to an event. They buy tickets in bulk at lower prices and selling them for higher prices to consumers.

From an economic standpoint, this is a form of price discrimination. Price discrimination can increase the level of efficiency in resource allocation within a monopoly market.

The practice of price discrimination can increase monopoly profits for the resellers while increasing efficiency for society, But, is the really high price for the ticket fair to the consumer?

The purchaser may believe the price is too high, but they still buy it so it's less than their max price.

## Regulating a Monopoly

They do not act in the best interest of society. When a natural monopoly exists, the government will intervene to help.

**Regulation** = a government rule that influences prices, quantities and entry along with other aspects of economic activity in a firm or industry.

**Deregulation** = process of removing the regulation of prices, quantities and entry along with other aspects of economic activity in a firm or industry.

Efficient regulation exists that serves social interest.

There are four possible regulations to discuss:

1. Marginal cost pricing rule

Price is set to equal the marginal cost. Maximum total surplus is achieved, but the price is less than the average cost and the firm incurs an economic loss. This is because the marginal revenue is decreasing, so while the marginal cost stays the same, the firm incurs a loss as it keeps producing. Stops where demand curve intersects the marginal cost.

The monopolist will have to be paid a subsidy by the government or be allowed to price discriminate in order to avoid economic loss.

2. Average cost pricing rule

Price is set to equal the average total cost. There is no loss, because the price is on the LRAC, but there is no profit. Output is efficient, but closer to the efficient level of output when compared to a monopoly that is unregulated.

3. Rate of Return Regulation

Price is set to the target rate of return on capital. Firm has to justify its price, such that zero economic profit results. But if this policy is used, an incentive exists to potentially promote inefficency.

Providing managers access to a private jet, etc, they don't have to operate efficiently.

4. Price cap regulation

Specifies the highest price that a firm is permitted to set, a price ceiling. Output is inefficient, but closer to the efficient level of output when compared to a monopoly that is unregulated.

Price cap regulations give a firm an incentive to minimize cost in order to earn an economic profit.

If the firm decreases costs and earns a profit, they'll be able to keep the profit, so the opportunity for profit exists. When economic profits rise above a target level, profit are typically shared with the firm's customers.

## How a Monopoly Arises

When compared to a firm in a competitive market, the monopoly firm:

* Produces less output
* Sells output at a higher price
* Produces less efficiently at a higher cost, resulting in a deadweight to society.
* Resources used in rent-seeking situations are costs to society that add to the monopoly's deadweight loss.

Monopolies can be regulated to attempt to reduce societal deadweight loss.

## Benefits of a Monopoly

1. **Research and Development**:

Monopolies, as larger firms, carry an advantage in terms of research and development and can develop new innovative goods and services that benefit both the firm and society.

Excessive economic profit can be used to fund research and development, *cough* Google.

For example, ATT has developed many innovations that have improved society. Historically a monopoly has increased R&D.

2. **Economies of Scale**:

Natural monopolies can capture large economies of scale that will benefit society holistically by lowering prices.

3. **Wage and Working Conditions**:

Large corporations like monopolies can often offer better wages and working conditions than smaller firms.

## Questions

1. Define the relationship between marginal revenue, marginal cost, and price when a single-price monopoly is maximizing profit.

A profit maximizing firm produces the amount of output that sets MR = MC < Price.

2. If a monopolist finds it is producing on the inelastic portion of the demand curve, what happens?

In the inelastic portion of the demand curve, the monopolist can reduce output and increase total revenue. Less output lowers total cost and increases profit.

3. Identify two examples of price discrimination among groups of buyers

Two examples of price discrimination among groups of buyers could be:

1. senior citizen discount on prescriptions
2. Or a grocery store that has a discount for students on a particular day of the week

4. Identify an example of a monopoly driven by a legal course of action:

Government gives spectrum to particular firm, no other firm can get into radio market.

5. Why is a single-price monopoly inefficent?

A perfectly competitive market is efficient because production occurs where the MSB = MSC, provided no externalities.

A monopolist is inefficent because price exceeds marginal cost at the quantity of output that the monopoly produces.

Consumer and producer surplus are not maximized and there is a deadweight loss.

6. What is a price cap and why might a price cap be an efficient way of regulating a monopoly?

A price cap is a price ceiling that sets the max price that a regulated firm can charge.

This form of regulation is more efficient than the rate of return regulation because the rate of return regulation gives managers an incentive to inflate their costs.

A price cap regulation gives the regulated firm the incentive to operate efficiently and not inflate its costs in order to turn a profit.
