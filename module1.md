# Module 1

Economics is the social science that studies choices that individuals, governments, businesses and societies make as they cope with **scarcity** and **incentives** that influence and reconcile choices.

We have unlimited wants, but resources are scarce, so we make choices based on positive or negative incentives.

**Positive statements** = about what is, statements that economists agree on.
**Normative statements** = what ought to be, more of an opinion, not testable. Not agreed upon.

**Microeconomics** = focuses on individual economic marker components like consumers, firms, and specific market activity. Consumer and firm behavior.

**Macroeconomics** = focuses on the economy from a broader level of activity, larger market sectors, relationships among market sectors. Overall economic health, growth, stability.

We want a marginal benefit greater than cost.

Opportunity cost = the costs, what we lose from alternatives when we pick a certain decision. Going to university has opportunity costs, the alternatives were relaxing or working, and the cost is loss of leisure time and money as a result of picking university.

One more hour of studying gives me x benefit, but y loss in sleeping/eating, etc. Is it worth it?

Two major forms of economic coordinated systems:

1. Central economic planning
2. Decentralized economic planning, our focus and the system of the West.

**Firm** = economic unit that hires factors of production, and organizes those factors of production to produce and sell goods or services.

**Market** = any arrangement that enables a buyer and a seller to get information and to do business with eachother.

**Factors Market** = factors of production, land, labour, capital, entrepeneurship.

**Household** = economic unit of one or more persons that provide economy with resources. Purchase goods and services with money.

Households exchange quantities of land, labour, capital, entrepeneurship, to firms for wages, rent, interest, profit.

Firms and households are interacting with markets, this interaction determines what will be produced, how it will be produced, and who will get what is produced.

Prices within markets coordinate the firms' and households' decisions.

## Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)

Y-axis, the cost and X-axis, the benefit.

Opportunity cost = ratio of what we give up to what we get.

**Marginal Cost** = the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of a good or service. The slope of the PPF is the cost for one benefit.

**Marginal Benefit** = benefits receive from consuming one or more unit of a good or service.

**Point of allocative efficiency** = occurs at the point on the PPF where the marginal benefit curve equals the marginal cost curve.

## Specialization and Trade

**Absolute Advantage** = One party can produce a larger amount of a good than anyone else given the same resources in a defined time period.

**Comparative Advantage** = In an activity, one person has a lower opportunity cost, get a lot for what it costs, for a particular good or service when compared to another. Export what you have an advantage in, import what you don't.
