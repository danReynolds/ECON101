# Module 2

**Market** = any arrangement that enables buyers and sellers to get info and to do business with eachother.

**Competitive Market** = a market which has many buyers and sellers and no single buyer or seller can influence the price.

**Money price of good/service** = the number of dollars that must be given up for the good/service.

**Producer** = wants to get a price for a good/service that is high enough to cover the opportunity cost, the things you lost in order to produce the good/service.

**Consumer** = respond to changing opportunity costs by seeking cheaper goods and services.

## Demand

Law of demand says that all else remaining the same, **ceteris paribus, the higher the price of a good or service, the smaller the quantity demanded and vice-versa.

**substitution effect** = when an increase in the relative price of a good or service occurs, consumers will purchase less of the good or service and more of a substitute for the good or service.

**income effect** = when an increase in the relative price of a good or service occurs, consumers have less money to spend on all goods and services, including the one whose price has increased.

## Demand Schedule

Shows the various quantities of a good or service that are demanded at each price, when all other influences on consumers' planned purchases remain the same.

So it is a mapping of price to quantity demanded.

## Demand Curve

The resulting curve when the points on the demand schedule are plotted out.

With price on y and quantity demanded on x, it approaches the y-axis asymptotically as the price becomes incredibly high and demand very low. Also called the marginal benefit curve. As the quantity produced increases, the worth of the item decreases.

A change in **quantity demanded** occurs due to a change in the price of a good or service itself.

A change in **demand** occurs due to a change in other influences of buying a good or service, not the price of the good or service itself.

## Factors that influence demand

Factors that influence the buying of many different goods and services are called **non-price determinants** of demand, or **shift factors** of demands.

For **normal goods**, when income increases, consumers tend to buy more of those goods and services. The demand for such a good relates directly to income.

Not all goods are considered normal goods. Some goods are **inferior** goods, an inferior good being a good whose demand relates inversely to income. There's a point at which box wine becomes silly to buy if you're rich. You buy the good stuff. Increased income, less desire for certain inferior goods.

# Supply

The price of a good or service impacts the quantity that producers plan to sell.

The law of supply states that, the higher the price of a good or service, the larger the quantity supplied will be. The higher the price of a good or service, the greater the incentive to produce and sell the good or service, as there is more profit, the item is hot right now.

Just like the demand curve and schedule, the supply curve has on its horizontal axis the quantity of the good produced and on its y-axis, the price of the good or service.

It is a positive function, the higher the price, the greater the amount produced because the greater the profit if all are sold.

**Since** marginal costs grow as more are produced, the price of the good or service must increase as more are produced.

If you make one mitten, it was relatively cheap, but if you have to make 1000 mittens, it is expensive and takes a while, so you charge more.

A supply curve is the marginal cost curve.

Like with demand, if a change in the quantity supplied occurs, the good or service will rise/fall in price. If a change in the supply occurs, because of some other factor, the curve shifts left or right depending on the change.

## Factors that influence supply

shift factors of supply, think like a producer. A substitute in production is a good or service that can be produced using the same resources. If one thing at a factory rises in price, switch to that, more profit in producing the more profitable thing.

A complement in production is a good or service that must be produced together. If the price of x rises, and y is made with x, then there will be more y produced too.

## Market Equilibrium - Equating Demand and Supply

When we put the demand and supply curve together, we can locate a market equilibrium price and quantity. This is the price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

At this price, the amount that sellers are willing and able to sell equals the amount that buyers are willing and able to buy.

Wherever the market is, it will always gravitate towards the market equilibrium. Market forces will push the price and quantity to the equilibrium.

For example, if there is an excess of a certain good, the price for the good will go down, so that all the goods they have can be sold at a lower price. Shifting the intersection point, the market equilibrium, right.

## Review Questions

1. Why is relative price considered an opportunity cost?

Relative price is an opportunity cost because it shows how much of the next best alternative good must be forgone to buy a unit of the first good.

3. When does a surplus arise?

A surplus arises when the market price is above the equilibrium price. The market demanded only 100, but we produced 150 so there is now a surplus of the good.

The surplus causes the price to fall, decreasing the quantity supplied and increasing the quantity demanded until equilibrium is achieved.

4. If early frost damages a crop, what happens?

Supply curve shifts left, decreasing supply and raising the price.

Eating more oranges can stop cancer?

Shifts demand right, raising the price and how much is bought.

5. A set of substitutes in production could be baked potates and french fries.

6. What happens to two different markets if the price of corn rises?

Movie tickets will have less demand, because tickets and corn are complements through popcorn.

Meanwhile, the demand for chips will increase, as chips and popcorn are substitutes and if corn is pricier, more people will turn to chips.
