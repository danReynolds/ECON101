# Definition of Economics

**Scarcity** = inability to get everything we want.

**Microeconomics** = study of the economics at an a individual, group, or company level. Focuses on an issue that affects individuals and companies.

**Macroeconomics** = study of a national or global economy as a whole.

The resources used to produce goods are called the **factors of production** and include:

1. Land: Natural resources, minerals, oil, animals, water, etc.
2. Labour: work and time people devote to producing goods and services. **Human Capital** is the knowledge that a person has from education and work-experience.
3. Capital: Tools, instruments, machines, buildings, that businesses use to produce goods and services. Not financial capital, money.
4. Entrepreneurship: The human resource that allocates land, labour and capital.

Land earns rent, labour earns wages, capital earns interest, entrepreneurship earns profit.

**Globalization** = the expansion of international trade, borrowing, lending and investment.

**Market Capitalism** = economic system in which individuals own land and capital and are free to buy and sell land, capital, goods and services to markets. There is no overarching decider, and outcomes are unintended and unforeseeable.

**Centrally Planned Socialism** = economic system in which the government owns all the land and capital, directs workers to jobs and decides what, how and for whom to produce. A few bureaucrats in positions of great power receive huge incomes.

The present economy is a mixed economy with market capitalism that is regulated by the government.

**Benefit** = the most that a person is willing to give up for something.

**Opportunity Cost** = the ratio of what you give up to what you get. The highest valued alternative that was given up in order to pursue an activity.

**Marginal Benefit** = the benefit of doing more of an activity.

**Marginal Cost** = the cost of doing more of an activity.

The marginal cost of studying that extra night is not being able to have fun. If the marginal benefit, the grade increase from increasing an activity like studying, is valued higher than the marginal cost of not being able to have fun, then study.

**Positive Statement** = statement about what is. Either right or wrong, can be verified as a fact.

**Normative Statement** = statement about what ought to be. Depends on the values and cannot be tested. Policy goals by politicians are normative statements. They cannot be verified for certain whether one decision or another will lead to a better outcome.

**Economic model** = description of some aspect of the economic world that includes only those features that are needed for the purpose at hand. Cell phones have names, but an economic model of cell phones would include the price of calls, number of users, and volume of calls, not the number of cell phones named 'Julian'.
