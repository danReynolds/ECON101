# Demand and Supply

Producers only offer items if the price is high enough to cover the opportunity cost, while the marginal benefit/demand curve is higher than the marginal cost/ supply curve.

A **relative price** is an opportunity cost, it is the ratio of the price of the items that could have been produced instead to the price of the items actually produced.

A price falling means that its relative price will fall, its price relative to other goods and services will fall.

## Demand

The **quantity demanded** is the amount that consumers plan to buy during a given time and at a given price. Not necessarily the same as quantity actually bought.

When all other things remain the same, how does one factor changing influence the price of a good or service?

**Substitution Effect** = When the relative price of a good increases, its substitutes will be bought more.

**Income Effect** = when the price of an item increases, consumers still have thes same income, so they must decrease what they buy, either of the item in question or others because they still need the more expensive item.

The term **demand** refers to the **entire** relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded of that good.  **Quantity demanded** refers to a single point on the demand curve, the quantity demanded of the good/service at a particular price.

A **demand curve** shows the relationship between the quantity demanded of a good and its price when all other influences on consumers' planned purchases remain the same.

The demand curve is also thought of as the **willingness and ability to pay curve**, which is the **marginal benefit**. The curve descends as the quantity increases, since people are willing to pay less for something more commonplace.

The curve has on its y-axis, the price per item, and on its x-axis, the quantity demanded of the item.

A **demand schedule** is a table version of this curve.

When any factor that influences buying changes, there is a **change in demand**.

Factors for influencing the demand curve:

1. The price of related goods:

If the substitute, alternative choices for the item increases in price, people buy more of the item since the alternative is now more expensive. If the item has a complement, like phones and phone cases, then if the price of the phone drops, more phones will be bought and more cases will be needed too.

2. Expected future prices:

If the price of a good is expected to go up, then people buy more immediately when it is cheaper. Similarly, if expected price falls, then people stop buying and wait for it to be cheaper.

3. Income:

Increased income leads to more demand for normal goods, but for inferior goods, which have better versions like box-wine vs aged-wine, as income increases, the inferior good is purchased less.

4. Expected future income and credit:

People act hastily when they think they're about to earn more, buy things ahead of time.

5. Population:

The larger the population, the greater the demand for all goods and services in general.

6. Preferences:

Demand depends on weather, popularity, fashion, etc.

## Change in Demand/Quantity Demanded

A shift of the demand curve shows a change in demand, while if you just move where you are on the demand curve from like $2.00 to $3.00, it will have a change in quantity demanded.

## Supply

the **quantity supplied** of a good or service is the amount that producers plan to sell during a given time period and at a particular price.

Higher prices increase the quantity supplied, because of the marginal cost. As the quantity increases, the marginal cost increases, and it is never worth creating more of a good if it does not cover the marginal cost. Then if the price of a good increases, you can increase the quantity before again hitting the point at which any more would have too high of a marginal cost.

A **supply curve** shows the relationship between the quantity supplied of a good and its price when all other influences remain the same.

The quantity of the good supplied is on the x-axis, and the price of the good is on the y-axis. As more is produced, the price must go up to cover increasing marginal costs. In this way, the supply curve can also be thought of as a marginal cost curve.

There are six factors that influence supply:

1. Prices of factors of production:

If the price of a FOP rises, then the marginal cost increases and if the price of the good isn't changing, then less of it must be produced to stay under the increasing marginal cost.

2. Price of related goods produced:

If the price of a substitute increases, more demand for the supplied good. Same with complimentary goods if the quantity of complementary good increases, so does the supplied good.

3. Expected Future Prices:

If the expected future price of a good rises, the return from selling the good in the future increases, so supply decreases until when it can be sold for more, when it will increase.

4. Number of Suppliers:

The more suppliers, the more quantity of the good, and the higher the price. The fewer suppliers, the lower the marginal cost and the less the quantity/price.

5. Technology:

The better the way of producing the good, the more supply of it, since it can be created for cheaper or in greater quantity.

6. The State of Nature:

Weather, conditions around people can influence the supply of a good. If an earthquake destroys a factory, then the supply of the good will go down.

## Change in Quantity Supplied/Change in Supply

A movement along the curve is a change in the quantity supplied, while a shift of the supply curve is a change in the supply.

## Market Equilibrium

the **Equilibrium price** is the price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

A market moves naturally towards equilibrum.

Shifts in demand: to the right, increases quantity, raises price. Left, decreases quantity, lowers price.

Shifts in supply: to the right, increases quantity, decreases price. Shift to the left, increases price, decreases quantity.

## Changes in both Supply and Demand

4 Cases:

1. Both increase, then quantity increases, new price unknown.

2. Both decrease, then quantity decreases, new price unknown.

3. Demand increase, supply decreases, then price increases, new quantity unknown.

4. Supply increases, demand decreases, price falls, new quantity unknown.
