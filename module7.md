# Module 7

**Firm** = an institution that hires factors of production and organizes those factors of production to produce and sell goods and services.

The factors of production being land, labour, capital and entrepenurship.

All firms have a goal to maximize profits.

## Accounting profits

**Implicit costs** = the sum of all hidden opportunity costs forgone, but not paid in real money.

ex. Person bought store with own capital. Person is giving up the interest income that she could have earned from renting the store to someone else, or from investing the capital instead of buying a store.

**Explicit costs** = costs that are a direct result of the use of the factors of production such as the wages to pay workers or rent to pay landlords.

**Conventional depreciation** = the fall in the value of a firm's capital, such as depreciation of machines after continued use.

**Accounting profit** = total revenue - (explicit costs + conventional depreciation)

revenue = quantity sold * price

**Economic profit** = total revenue - total cost

With total cost being measured as the total opportunity cost of production.

A firm's **total opportunity cost of production** = explicit costs + implicit costs

Therefore **economic profit** = total revenue - ( explicit costs + implicit costs )

## Opportunity Cost of production

the value of the best alternative use of the resources that a firm uses in production which is comprised of both implicit and explicit costs.

**Opportunity cost of production** = cost of resources bought in the market + cost of resources owned by the firm + cost of resources supplied by the firm's owner.

1. cost of resources bought in the market: resources that the firm would buy to create a good or service, such as supplies and labour.

2. cost of resources owned by the firm: Incurs a cost when uses own capital, it implicitly rents the capital from itself. Opportunity cost of using own capital is called the **Implicit Rental Rate of Capital**.

**Implicit Rental Rate of Capital** = economic depreciation, the change in the market value of capital over a given period of time + interest foregone, the interest that could have been gained by instead investing the money used to acquire the capital.

3. cost of resources supplied by the firm's owner: The return for the owner for their entrepenurship is profit. The profit that an entrepeneur earns on average is normal profit. Minimum profit that must be earned to keep the entrepeneur in business.

Wage income foregone is also a cost associated with the resources supplied by the firm's owner.

**Economic profit** tells us where a firm is using its resources efficiently.

## Economic Accounting

ex.

Total revenue: $400 000

Cost of resources in market:

$230 000

Cost of resources owned by the firm:

Economic depreciation: $25000
Forgone interest: $15000

Cost of resources supplied by the owner:

entrepeneur's normal profit: $45000 // Sub
forgone wages: $55000

Therefore total revenue - explicit cost - implicit cost = $30 000

## Relation between Accounting and Economic Profit

Accounting profit tells us if a firm has enough revenue to cover expenses.

Economic profit tells us where a firm is using resources efficiently and can predict a firm's actions.

Economic profit includes implicit costs, while accounting profit does not. The discipline of account has strict accounting costs.

Economic profit is **over and above normal profit**.

Economic profit will be less than accounting profit, as economic profit subtracts implicit costs and accounting profit does not.

Economic profit reflects the full opportunity cost of doing business. If it is negative, it says that the firm has not made smart business decisions, because they would have been better off using money elsewhere.

## Constraints that Limit a Firm's Profits:

1. Technology Constraints

**Technology** = any method of producing a good or service. At the existing level of technology, a firm can produce more output only if it hires more resources.

2. **Information Constraints** = The cost of coping with limited information itself limits profits. A firm is constrained by the limited amount of info about the quality and quantity of its workforce, current and future buying habits of consumers and the competition's plans.

3. **Market Constraints** = What a firm can sell and the price a firm can charge are constrained by its consumer's willingness to pay and by the prices affecting markets.

**Technological Efficiency** = when a firm produces a given output by using the least amounts of inputs.

It minimizes the quantity of resources used to generate a given level of output. Which does not necessarily equate to the use of the latest technologies.

As long as a firm is achieving the maximum possible outputs for a combination of given inputs, it is technologically efficient.

**Economic Efficiency** = when a firm produces a given output at the least possible cost.

A technologically efficient process might not be economically efficient, as the inputs could be expensive. But an economically efficient process is always technologically efficient, as it had to minimize cost.

## Information Constraints

All firms organize production using a variety of command and incentive systems.

A command system leverages a managerial hierarchy, from directors to CFOs to CEO. It is hard for senior managers to see everything below them, so they use an incentive system, which is a market-like mechanism inside a firm.

A sales rep is often out seeing clients and customers to sell service. To ensure employees use this unsupervised time, the sales rep makes money per sale.

## Principal-Agent Problem:

Devising compensation rules that induce an agent to act in the best interests of a principal. The managers are agents, shareholders are principals. Shareholders provide incentives to ensure that manager's decisions are inline with maximizing profit.

* Assign ownership of part of the firm to the manager
* Incentive pay
* Long-term contracts that have long-term rewards associated with long-term profitability

## Business Organization Structures

1. Sole proprietorship: Single owner, owner takes on full debts. Risk is high if firm goes bankrupt, have to cover up to own wealth. Most common form of business organization. Minimal legal and accounting requirements.

2. Partnership: A partnership has 1 or more owners, like a law firm.

3. Corporation: A corporation is a firm that is owned by one or more shareholders. Shareholders only pay initially, don't have any obligation if the firm goes bankrupt. But shareholders get taxed more heavily.

## Types of markets

1. Perfect Competition: Market has many firms, with perfect substitutes, like wheat which is all pretty much the same, and no restrictions to firms entering the market.

2. Monopoly: One firm, no close substitutes and there is a barrier to entry for other firms to try and get in the market.

3. Monopolistic Competition: Market has many firms with slightly differentiated goods and services. There are many different types of clothes or phones.

There are no restrictions on entry into the market.

4. Oligopoly: Few farms with almost identical or slight differentiation. Medium restrictions to entry. Market only has a few companies, the goods and services are almost the same with small changes like Coke and Pepsi. Only a couple big players and not that different.
