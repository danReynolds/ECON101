# Module 3

**Elasticity** = how a change in one variable affects another.

**Price Elasticity of demand** = measure how responsive demanders are to a change in the price of a good or service. It is a measure of the change of the quantity demanded as a result of a change when all other influences remain the same.

it is equal to:

$ \frac{percentage change in quantity demanded}{percentage change in price} $

average delta quantity over average delta price.

$E_d$ represents the elasticity of demand. Always take the magnitude.

price 14, quantity 500
price 16, quantity 400

$E_d$ is the change in quantity demanded divided by the average quantity, over the change in price over the average price.

This is: $\frac{\frac{100}{450}}{\frac{-2}{15}}$

this is $\frac{0.222}{-0.133} = -1.67$

but we take the absolute. This shows us that changing the price by 1 changes the quantity demanded by 1.67

**Perfectly inelastic demand** = the quantity demanded of a good or service does not change when its price changes.

This is the line $x=i$ for some integer i, where the x-axis is quantity and the y-axis is price.

In this case, the price elasticity of demand is 0.

**Perfectly elastic demand** = the quantity demanded of a good or service changes by an infinitely large percentage in response to a minute change in price.

This is the line $y=i$ for some i.

an example is when two adjacent drink machines have the same price, but then one goes a little higher. Now everyone will buy from only one, and the other has no quantity.

**Unit elastic demand** = the quantity demanded of a good or service changes by the same amount as the change in price. The elastic demand is 1.

When $E_d$ > 1, the demand is **elastic**.

When $0 < E_d < 1$ the demand is **inelastic**.

So elasticity shows how much demand changes in response to price changing. Tobacco for instance is inelastic because a change in price won't alter demand much.

**Cross elasticity of demand** = measure of responsiveness of the demand for a good or service to a change in the price of a **different** good or service with all else remaining the same.

$\frac{change in demand of one thing}{change in price of other thing}$

use $E_xy$ to represent the cross elasticity of demand, where x and y are two different goods/services.

can be positive or negative, since might be good or bad for the other good or service to increase in price and vice-versa.

If $Exy$ is positive, then the goods or services are substitutes, since an increase in price leads to an increase in demand of the other.

If $Exy$ is negative, then the goods or services are complements. Increasing the price of one good decreases the demand of the other because they are bought together.

**Income elasticity of demand** = measure of responsiveness of the demand for a good or service to a change in income, all other things remaining the same.

It is represented by $E_i$. If $E_i$ > 1, then the good is a normal good. As income increases, the demand for the item increases.

If 0 < $E_i$ < 1, then the good or service is still a normal good, but it is income inelastic. It does not change much in demand if the income changes.

if $E_i$ < 0 then the good or service is an inferior good, since increasing the income decreases the demand for the good.

## Factors that influence Elasticity of Supply

1. Possibilities for resource substitution. **Substitutes in production** = goods or services that can be produced by using the same resources.

more substitutes = more elasticity.

Muffins need a lot of resources. But if you run out of sugar for example, there are sugar substitutes you can use, so you don't stop making the item.

This means you have a large elasticity of supply.

If there are no substitutes, you'd have to stop producing the item for a time, which is a small elasticity of supply.

2. Time frame for a supply decision

some goods take much longer than others to produce. Some can change their supply resources/processes quickly and some can't. The longer the time frame for a supply decision, the higher the price elasticity of supply.

elasticity of supply can be used to forecast future outputs and amount.

Price elasticity of supply is the change in the quantity supplied over the change in price. Like demand, both the numerator and denominator are divided by their averages.
