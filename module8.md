## Perfect Competition

* Many firms
* Many perfect substitutes
* No restrictions on entry

Consumers don't really care where they purchase the good or service, like wheat. Anyone can become a wheat farmer and there are no restrictions or barriers.

Finding an industry meeting this *exact* definition is difficult.

Firms are price takers, in a perfect competitive market, a firm cannot influence its own price and sets their own price equal to the market price.

So increasing the good or service's total output will not influence the price. A wheat farmer who produces a lot or a little is at the mercy of the overall price for wheat.

If they lower price, they lose money, if they raise the price, they will not be purchased. They are therefore **price takers**.

The market demand curve for a good or service in a perfectly competitive market is downward sloping. The firm has a perfectly elastic demand curve. If they change cost any more or less, the change demanded will change infinitely.

The marginal revenue is the change in total revenue that results from a one unit increase is the market price and is constant as output increases.

Firms want to maximize economic profit, revenue - cost.

## Firm's decisions

To achieve maximum economic profit, a firm must decide upon:

1. How to produce at the minimum cost:

A firm produces minimum cost by operating with a plant that minimizes long-run average cost.

2. What quantity to produce:

A firm can use two approaches to identify the point of output that equates to a firm's maximizing profit:

* From the firm's cost curves and total revenue curves. Sometimes called the total-revenue-total-cost approach.

* From marginal analysis. Sometimes called the marginal-revenue-marginal-cost approach. Looks at marginal revenue and cost to determine the quantity to produce. Maximizes profit at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The extra cost of producing one more unit would have higher cost than revenue, so stop there.

This is the exact point at which the cost of producing one more unit is the same cost as selling one more unit. If you make more revenue than your costs, keep going to get more profit.

if MR > MC, produce more
if MR < MC, produce less
if MR = MC, stop

This is simple, but if this MR = MC price is less than the average total cost, then there is an economic loss. If you produce any more, then you'd be incurring a loss. Currently your cost is MC * cost, **marginal cost makes a rectangle, all are now sold at that current price**.. Since MC is <= MR, you're not taking a loss. If the firm believes it will continue to lose profit over the long run, it should close, otherwise it should temporarily shut down and take a loss.

A firm decides to either shut down production temporarily or keep producing based on the firm's **shutdown point**.

**shutdown point** = price and quantity at which the firm is indifferent between producing and shutting down.

The output and price that allows a firm to cover its variable costs.

The point is where the average variable cost reaches its minimum, since the revenue stays the same, we want to minimize AVC as past that, it will go up. AVC is U-shaped because of the law of diminishing returns.

For firms with a loss, when price of the good is equal to AVC, average variable cost, the firm will elect to continue to produce. Even though it has fixed costs too, those are unavoidable and they have **no impact** when deciding to choose to shut down or make an economic decision in the short run.

When P >= AVC, keeps producing. If P < AVC, the firm will temporarily shut down. The firm still needs to pay its fixed cost, so if P < AVC it is losing both the fixed cost and the additional AVC.

The firm's supply curve is the part of the AVC curve above the fixed price.

3. Whether to enter or exit a market:

**Short-run market supply curve** = shows the quantity supplied by all firms in the market at each price when each firm's plant and number of firms remain the same.

It's the sum of all quantities supplied by everyone in the market for that price.

Market demand and the short-run market supply curve determine the market price and market output over the short run.

Increase in demand, price increases and more produced by each firm.

Over the short run, a firm might make an economic profit, or break even or make a loss over the short run.

ATC cost makes a rectangle, as we take the ATC at that price and multiple it by the quantity. ATC is what if each item for quantity x is produced at y where y is the value of the ATC curve. So if x = 100 and y = 10, then at the ATC = 1000

If P > ATC = profit
If P < ATC = loss
If P = ATC = breaks even

## Long-Run Equilibrium

Firms can enter or exit a market in the long run. Economic profit or loss signals firms to enter or exit a market.

New firms are attracted to markets that make an economic profit. When new firms enter a market, the market supply curve shifts rightward, which causes the market price to fall from the flooding of goods in the market.

Eventually the market price falls to equal the minimum ATC for each firm and plants adjust their supply size.

But at this price, firms no longer earn an economic profit and firms no longer enter the market.

So the number of firms increases, the total quantity produced in the industry increases, and in the long run, competitive firms will adjust to an equilibrium of earning zero economic profit.

This triggers firms to leave the market, as it is no longer profitable.

## Summary

In a perfectly competitive market, over the long run:

1. Every firm in the industry makes zero economic profit
2. Every firm produces at the lowest cost possible

Society is gaining, but entrepeneurs are not, they're only covering their costs.

## Changing Tastes and Advancing Technologies

To address how changes in taste impact the long-run equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market, we need to consider how a permanent change in demand affects long-run equilibrium in the perfectly competitive market.

The change in long-run equilibrium price in a competitive market depends upon external economies and external diseconomies:

**External Economies** = factors beyond the control of the individual firm that lower a firm's costs as the industry output expands

**External Diseconomies** = factors beyond the control of the individual firm that raise a firm's costs as the industry expands.

**Long-run market supply curve** = shows how the quantity supplied in a market varies as the market price varies, after all possible adjustments have been made.

When the demand changes in a perfectly competitive market, the long-run supply curve depends on the existence or absence of external diseconomies and external economies.

If demand increases and new firms enter the market:

1. When an industry faces constant costs: Then long-run equilibrium price is constant. The long-run equilibrium quantity produced increases (makes sense, demand increase leads to more firms leads to more supply). The long-run supply curve is perfectly elastic.

2. When an industry faces increasing costs: Then long run equilibrium price increases, long-run equilibrium quantity produced increases, long-run supply curve is upward sloping (because demand increased more than supply, since we can't supply as much due to increasing costs, follows price, so priced increased, so the long run supply curve is also upward slope).

3. When an industry faces decreasing costs: Then long-run equilibrium price decreases (because supply curve shifts right more than demand due to low costs). Long-run equilibrium quantity produced increases. Long-run supply curve is downward sloping (follows price so price dropped, supply curve dropped).

The shape of the long-run cost curve varies:

* For a constant cost industry: the long-run cost curve is horizontal
* For an increasing cost industry: the long-run cost curve is an upward sloping line
* For a decreasing cost industry: the long-run cost curve is a downward sloping line

## Effects of a Permanent Decrease in demand

A permanent decrease in demand impacts the short and long-run equilibrium in a competitive market.

In the short-run, a permanent decrease in demand decreases the market quantity and the market price falls below the minimum ATC for each firm.

Firms in the industry incur a loss and shut down. The market supply curve shifts left due to the loss of firms in the market. The market price rises (like it always does with a supply shift left) and the quantity decreases (as a result of the shift in the supply curve).

The price increases, because the supply curve shifted left.

The increase in market price shrinks the economic loss for each remaining firm.

Firms exit the industry until the price again equals the minimum price on each firm's average total cost curve. At this point people get to profit and stop leaving.

In the long run, with no external economies or diseconomies, market price returns to the original level, market output is less than the original, economic profit for each firm will return to 0.

## Technological change

New technological advances impact the short and long-run equilibrium.

In the short run, industry firms that adopt new technology lower their cost and their supply curves shift rightward.

Industry firms that continue to use old technology incur an economic loss as their costs remain the same, but price falls due to supply shift in the overall market.

Industry firms using older technology eventually either adopt the new technology or leave the industry.

In the long run, all firms in the industry use the new technology. Economic profit for each firm returns to zero. Market price falls to the new minimum average total cost curve for each firm, since demand stays same but supply increases due to better tech.

## Efficient Use of resources

Resource allocation is efficient when production is such that the marginal social benefit of the good equals marginal social cost. Makes sense, producing anymore would be at greater social cost than benefit.

Does a perfectly competitive market efficiently allocate resources?

In a competitive equilibrium, the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

Then if there are no externalities, so if the only people that benefit are those that buy and the only people that it costs are the people who produce it, the firm, then the *demand curve is the same as the marginal social benefit curve and the marginal supply curve is the marginal social supply curve*.

At competitive market equilibrium, marginal social benefit equals the marginal social cost. Resources are being used efficiently. This means that firms make zero, since the marginal social benefit is the sum of all demanded at a given price, and marginal social cost is sum of all supplied at a certain cost. When they're equal, total production cost is same as total revenue, and there can be **no profit**.
